pkdb_data: python utilities for PK-DB data
==========================================
This repository stores the curated study data for `https://pk-db.com <https://pk-db.com>`__ and provides helpers for uploading studies to
the database. The available choices are defined as part of this repository.

* `./studies/ <./studies/>`__: curated study data with subfolders based on substances
* `./pkdb_data/info_nodes/ <./pkdb_data/info_nodes/>`__: definition of data base choices
* `./CURATION.md <./CURATION.md>`__: curation guidelines and choices

See the `./CURATION.md <./CURATION.md>`__ for detailed instructions on how to curate studies.

Installation
============
Installation instructions are available `here <https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/pkdb_data/blob/develop/CURATION.md#setup>`__.

Functionality in a nutshell
===========================
The following provides a short overview over the main functionality.
Detailed information is provided in the `./CURATION.md <./CURATION.md>`__.

Upload study
------------
To upload a study use

.. code-block:: console

    (pkdb_data) upload_study -s <study_dir>

Upload studies
--------------
A set of studies can be uploaded via

.. code-block:: console

    (pkdb_data) upload_studies

Use the `-s` flag to only upload subsets, e.g., to upload all `caffeine` and `acetaminophen` studies use

.. code-block:: console

    (pkdb_data) upload_studies -s caffeine acetaminophen


Delete study
------------
.. code-block:: console

    (pkdb_data) delete_study -s <study_sid>


Update InfoNodes
----------------
Modifying and uploading InfoNodes which can be used as choices in the curation is restricted to the admins.
To update the notes modify the information in `./pkdb_data/info_nodes/ <./pkdb_data/info_nodes/>`__ and create the `json` information via

.. code-block:: console

    (pkdb_data) create_nodes

In a second step the nodes are uploaded via

.. code-block:: console

    (pkdb_data) upload_nodes
