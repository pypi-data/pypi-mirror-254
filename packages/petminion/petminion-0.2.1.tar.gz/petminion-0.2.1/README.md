# Petminion

![Build Status](https://github.com/petminion/petminion/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)

## Project principles

* A generalized tool for (semi?) automated training of animals (initially: cats, dogs, crows)
* Use machine vision to simplify hardware and training
* Use 'off-the-shelf' hardware as much as possible (hopefully no soldering, no requirement for 3D printing)
* Make the software accessible and extendable by beginning coders
* Easy for anyone to add new training rules
* Project should be fun and useful for both the developers and the users

## Required hardware

FIXME

## Installing

This project is probably not yet ready for others, so you should probably not install for now... 

But!

This framework is written in python and intended to be run on something like a raspberry pi.  However, if you are just interested in trying it out it can even be run on a desktop (where the feeder hardware and/or camera is simulated).

To install, run the following command on any machine which has a recent python version installed.  

```
$ pipx install petminion
  installed package petminion 0.2.0, installed using Python 3.11.6
  These apps are now globally available
    - petminion
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```

This tool is mostly written for linux, but if you find problems on other platforms please open a github issue and we'll try to figure out what's wrong.

## Running

Run 'petminion' from your command line and it should hopefully do something (FIXME).  Here's approximately how it should look.

```

## Development Schedule

I'll be writing the first version in Winter of 2023 (in this github) and then iterating with my cat and black winged test subjects through the winter and spring.
If you'd like to contact me, I'm kevinh@geeksville.com.

## Training rules

The trainer works by using short 'training rules' to provide tasks/rewards to the animals.  Initially we have a few sample rules, but hopefully over time people will write (and distribute) other rules.  So that collaboratively we can build a set of rules for different animals, tasks and settings.

To drive initial development @geeksville is using two use-case rules.  One for his cat and other for the birds on his deck.

### Sample cat training

Machine vision test of mylar balls went poorly.
Springs also probably not ideal.
Next to try is felt pom-pom balls sold as cat toys (some sort of colored ball would also work for birds someday?).  
Use colored gaffers tape (which can be HSV encoded for standard tapes) to mark target area. 
Eventually for crows brightly colored poker chips would be easily countable.

FIXME: Notes on how to do this: Use a simple color based recognizer (https://dontrepeatyourself.org/post/color-based-object-detection-with-opencv-and-python/).  
Use find contours to find N balls in the camera view: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71491995/how-to-count-the-color-detected-objects-using-opencv 
Optionally check for roundness by comparing % of minimum enclosing circle to the discovered contours: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html.  or use matchShapes https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/d45/tutorial_py_contours_more_functions.html 
contour docs: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html
https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html
Use this HSV picker on reference image: https://getimagecolor.com/#pick-color
Use cheap/weatherproof colored gaffers tape to mark target regions etc.  Much better than requiring a painted board for a target because we can use HSV colors & contours to robustly find target regions.

level 0 attempt CatTrainingRule:

- look for targets (pom-poms) on a color-coded shelf (so balls above shelf height are ignored by the machine vision).  If cat knocks pom-pom off shelf they get food for each pom-pom  
- count number of pom-poms seen.
- if number of springs increases & cat present -> emit food (if # feed events per day not reached - or implicitly limited by # of springs in house)

level 1 attempt CatTrainingRule:

- as above but pom-poms must be delivered by cat to viewing area (delimited by HSV encoded gaffers tape).  Initially placed just to left of viewing.  

level 2 attempt CatTrainingRule:

- pom-poms now placed outside of test room occasionally by human.  For each pom-pom delivered cat gets treat.

level 3 attempt CatTrainingRule:

- humans randomly place pom-poms around house for cat to discover and exchange for treats


level n attempt CatTrainingRule:

- after spring seen and feed event -> power GPIO to somehow empty the target area

### Sample crow training

level 0 attempt (keep food always present CrowTrainingRule0):

- look at target and if no food present -> emit food

level 1 attempt (only emit food once we see a bird - to get birds used to feeder noise):

- look at target no food and no bird -> emit food 

level 2 attempt (only feed crows):

- look at target no food and no crow -> emit food 

level 3 attempt (provide tokens on a shelf just above target - hopefully crow knocks tokens into target)

- look at target no food, no crow and no token -> emit food

level 4 attempt (provide tokens nearby but not on shelf)

- same as above except tokens are not close, also we will count anything as a 'token' doesn't have to be the tokens we provided

FIXME - add GPIO control to empty unused food and empty tokens.
