Welcome to the documentation for fiasco. fiasco provides a Python interface to the `CHIANTI atomic database`_. In addition to several high-level abstractions of the atomic data, fiasco also provides many common atomic physics calculations. fiasco takes much of its inspiration from the `ChiantiPy`_ package which provides similar functionality.

.. warning:: fiasco currently only supports version 8 of the CHIANTI database.
