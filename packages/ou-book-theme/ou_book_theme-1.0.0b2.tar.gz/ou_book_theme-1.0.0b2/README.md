## Installation

pip install ou-book-theme
```

See the [docs/](docs) for further documentation.

## Development

To reduce any code formatting and layouting issues, the project uses the [Black formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

To ensure that your code follows the formatting, a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) is provided, which can be installed via

```console
pre-commit install
```
