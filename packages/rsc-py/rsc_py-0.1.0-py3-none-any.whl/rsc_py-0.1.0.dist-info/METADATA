# RSCPy: PowerPoint Remote Show Control Library

`RSCPy` is a Python library designed to remotely control PowerPoint presentations using the Remote Show Control add-in. This library enables the sending of commands to control PowerPoint presentations over network connections using both UDP and TCP protocols.

## Features

- Open and close PowerPoint presentations
- Start and stop presentations
- Navigate through slides (next, previous, go to specific slide)
- Set the desktop background to the current slide (experimental feature)
- Find PowerPoint files within a specified directory

## Installation

To install `RSCPy`, simply use pip:

```pip install rsc_py```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PowerPoint with the [Remote Show Control](https://www.irisdown.co.uk/rsc.html) add-in installed

## Usage

Here's a quick start to control PowerPoint presentations:

```python
from rsc_py import RSCPy
import time

# Initialize the controller with the IP address of the PowerPoint PC
controller = RSCPy('192.168.1.1', protocol='TCP')

# Open a presentation
controller.open_presentation('path/to/presentation.pptx')

# Start the presentation and wait
controller.run_presentation()
time.sleep(3)

# Go to the next slide and wait
controller.next_slide()
time.sleep(3)

# Close the presentation
controller.close_presentation('path/to/presentation.pptx')
```

## Supported Commands
- ```open_presentation(filename)```: Opens a specified presentation.
- ```close_presentation(filename=None)```: Closes the specified or all presentations.
- ```run_presentation(filename=None)```: Starts the presentation.
- ```run_current()```: Starts the presentation from the current slide.
- ```stop_presentation(filename=None)```: Stops the presentation.
- ```prev_slide()```: Moves to the previous slide.
- ```next_slide()```: Moves to the next slide.
- ```go_to_slide(slide)```: Moves to a specified slide.
- ```set_background()```: Sets the desktop background to the current slide (will not work on Automatic in PPT 2013+).
- ```find_files(path)```: Finds PowerPoint files in the specified path.
