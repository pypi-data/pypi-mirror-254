Summary: Easy to use vocal separation on CLI or as a python package, using the amazing MDX-Net models from UVR trained by @Anjok07

Audio Separator is a Python package that allows you to separate an audio file into two stems, primary and secondary, using a model in the ONNX format trained by @Anjok07 for use with UVR (https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui).

The primary stem typically contains the instrumental part of the audio, while the secondary stem contains the vocals, but in some models this is reversed.

## Features

- Separate audio into instrumental and vocal stems.
- Supports all common audio formats (WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, etc.)
- Ability to specify a pre-trained deep learning model in ONNX format.
- CLI support for easy use in scripts and batch processing.
- Python API for integration into other projects.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### üéÆ Nvidia GPU with CUDA acceleration

üí¨ If successfully configured, you should see this log message when running audio-separator:
 `ONNXruntime has CUDAExecutionProvider available, enabling acceleration`

Conda: `conda install pytorch=*=*cuda* onnxruntime=*=*cuda* audio-separator -c pytorch -c conda-forge`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[gpu]"`

Docker: `beveradb/audio-separator:gpu`

### üß™ Google Colab

Colab has recently upgraded to CUDA 12, which isn't yet supported by the official ONNX Runtime releases.

To get `audio-separator` working with GPU acceleration on colab, first install this `onnxruntime-gpu` wheel (which I built with CUDA 12 support):

`pip install https://github.com/karaokenerds/python-audio-separator/releases/download/v0.12.1/onnxruntime_gpu-1.17.0-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`

Then install audio-separator:
`pip install "audio-separator[gpu]"`

### üê¢ No hardware acceleration, CPU only:

Conda: `conda install audio-separator-c pytorch -c conda-forge`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[cpu]"`

Docker: `beveradb/audio-separator`

### Ô£ø Apple Silicon, macOS Sonoma+ with CoreML acceleration

üí¨ If successfully configured, you should see this log message when running audio-separator:
 `ONNXruntime has CoreMLExecutionProvider available, enabling acceleration`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[silicon]"`

### FFmpeg dependency (if using pip)

If you installed `audio-separator` using `pip`, you'll separately need to ensure you have `ffmpeg` installed.
This should be easy to install on most platforms, e.g.:

üêß Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get update; apt-get install -y ffmpeg`

Ô£ø macOS:`brew update; brew install ffmpeg`


## GPU / CUDA specific installation steps with Pip

In theory, all you should need to do to get `audio-separator` working with a GPU is install it with the `[gpu]` extra as above.

However, sometimes getting both PyTorch and ONNX Runtime working with CUDA support can be a bit tricky so it may not work that easily.

You may need to reinstall both packages directly, allowing pip to calculate the right versions for your platform:

- `pip uninstall torch onnxruntime`
- `pip cache purge`
- `pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision torchaudio`
- `pip install --force-reinstall onnxruntime-gpu`

Depending on your hardware, you may get better performance with the optimum version of onnxruntime:
- `pip install --force-reinstall "optimum[onnxruntime-gpu]"`

Depending on your CUDA version and hardware, you may need to install torch from the `cu118` index instead:
- `pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`

> Note: if anyone knows how to make this cleaner so we can support both different platform-specific dependencies for hardware acceleration without a separate installation process for each, please let me know or raise a PR!

## Usage in Docker üê≥

There are [images published on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/beveradb/audio-separator/tags) for GPU (CUDA) and CPU inferencing, for both `amd64` and `arm64` platforms.

You probably want to volume-mount a folder containing whatever file you want to separate, which can then also be used as the output folder.

For example, if the current directory contains your input file `input.wav`, you could run `audio-separator` like so:

```
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/workdir beveradb/audio-separator input.wav
```

If you're using a machine with a GPU, you'll want to use the GPU specific image and pass in the GPU device to the container, like this:

```
docker run -it --gpus all -v `pwd`:/workdir beveradb/audio-separator:gpu input.wav
```

If the GPU isn't being detected, make sure your docker runtime environment is passing through the GPU correctly - there are [various guides](https://www.celantur.com/blog/run-cuda-in-docker-on-linux/) online to help with that.

### As a Dependency in a Python Project

You can use Audio Separator in your own Python project. Here's how you can use it:

```
from audio_separator.separator import Separator

# Initialize the Separator class (with optional configuration properties below)
separator = Separator()

# Load a machine learning model (if unspecified, defaults to 'UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3')
separator.load_model()

# Perform the separation on specific audio files without reloading the model
primary_stem_output_path, secondary_stem_output_path = separator.separate('audio1.wav')

print(f'Primary stem saved at {primary_stem_output_path}')
print(f'Secondary stem saved at {secondary_stem_output_path}')
```

#### Batch processing, or processing with multiple models

You can process multiple separations without reloading the model, to save time and memory.

You only need to load a model when choosing or changing models. See example below:

```
from audio_separator.separator import Separator

# Initialize the Separator with other configuration properties below
separator = Separator()

# Load a model
separator.load_model('UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3')

# Separate multiple audio files without reloading the model
output_file_paths_1 = separator.separate('audio1.wav')
output_file_paths_2 = separator.separate('audio2.wav')
output_file_paths_3 = separator.separate('audio3.wav')

# Load a different model
separator.load_model('UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2')

# Separate the same files with the new model
output_file_paths_4 = separator.separate('audio1.wav')
output_file_paths_5 = separator.separate('audio2.wav')
output_file_paths_6 = separator.separate('audio3.wav')
```

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are very much welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes, and I'll try to review, merge and publish promptly!

- This project is 100% open-source and free for anyone to use and modify as they wish. 
- If the maintenance workload for this repo somehow becomes too much for me I'll ask for volunteers to share maintainership of the repo, though I don't think that is very likely
- Development and support for the MDX-Net separation models is part of the main [UVR project](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui), this repo is just a CLI/Python package wrapper to simplify running those models programmatically. So, if you want to try and improve the actual models, please get involved in the UVR project and look for guidance there!
