These things are already taken care of in the official Ubo Pod image, so if you are
botting from that image, you can ignore this section.

- Run `raspi-config` -> Interface Options -> Enable SPI

## üì¶ Installation

Note that as part of the installation process, these debian packages are installed:

- virtualenv
- libmtdev1
- libgl1
- libegl1
- libcap-dev

Also be aware that ubo-app only installs in `/opt/ubo` and it is not customizable
at the moment.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Executing scripts directly from the internet with root privileges poses a significant
security risk. It's generally a good practice to ensure you understand the script's
content before running it.**

---

To install ubo, run this command in a terminal shell:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubopod/ubo-app/main/ubo_app/system/install.sh | sudo bash
```
