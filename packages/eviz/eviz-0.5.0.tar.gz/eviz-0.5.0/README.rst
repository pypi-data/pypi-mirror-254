EVIZ: An Easy to Use Earth Modeling System Visualization Tool
=============================================================

`EViz` consists of two Python-based visualization libraries, `eViz` and `iViz`, that can process a variety
of model generated output and produce a corresponding variety of diagnostic plots. These libraries are intended 
to be used, first and foremost, as a validation tool for earth system model data. Though both sets of libraries 
process the same diagnostic datasets, there are clear distinctions between eViz and iViz in terms of the 
functionality they provide. eViz provides static diagnostic images based on the matplotlib python visualization 
library. iViz provides interactive images and panels based on the holoviz python visualization library. 
We recommend users use one or both of these tools based on their needs. eViz is great for fast and at-a-glance 
diagnostic, and iViz allows for both fast diagnostics and GUI-based investigation.
