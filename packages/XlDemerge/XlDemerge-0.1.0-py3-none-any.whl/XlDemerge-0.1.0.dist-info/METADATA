# XlDemerge

XlDemerge is a Python library designed to facilitate working with Excel files by offering utilities to unmerge cells and manipulate data using `openpyxl`, `pandas`, and `numpy`. It provides a set of functions that allow users to unmerge cells in Excel sheets, either entirely, by rows, or by columns, and then process the data into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis or manipulation.

## Installation

To install XlDemerge, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install XlDemerge
```

## Dependencies

XlDemerge requires the following Python libraries:
- openpyxl==3.1.2
- pandas==1.5.3
- numpy==1.23.5

Ensure these are installed in your environment to use XlDemerge effectively.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use XlDemerge:

### Unmerging All Cells in a Sheet

```python
from XlDemerge import cell_unmerge

# Path to your Excel file and the sheet name
file_path = "path/to/your/excel.xlsx"
sheet_name = "Sheet1"

# Unmerge all cells and get data as a pandas DataFrame
df = cell_unmerge(file_path, sheet_name)
print(df)
```

### Unmerging Rows Only

```python
from XlDemerge import rows_unmerge

df = rows_unmerge(file_path, sheet_name)
print(df)
```

### Unmerging Columns Only

```python
from XlDemerge import columns_unmerge

df = columns_unmerge(file_path, sheet_name)
print(df)
```

### Getting a List of Merged Cell Ranges

```python
from XlDemerge import merged_cell_range

merged_ranges = merged_cell_range(file_path, sheet_name)
print(merged_ranges)
```

## Features

- Unmerge cells in an Excel sheet and fill with the original top-left value.
- Support for unmerging by rows, columns, or all merged cells.
- Conversion of Excel data to pandas DataFrame post-unmerge.
- Identification of merged cell ranges in a sheet.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the creators and contributors of openpyxl, pandas, and numpy for their amazing libraries that made this project possible.
