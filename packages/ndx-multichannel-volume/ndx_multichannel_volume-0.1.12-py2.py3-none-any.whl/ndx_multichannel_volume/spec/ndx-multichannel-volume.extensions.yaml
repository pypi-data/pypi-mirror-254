    doc: Each external image may contain one or more consecutive frames of the full
      ImageSeries. This attribute serves as an index to indicate which frames each
      file contains, to faciliate random access. The 'starting_frame' attribute, hence,
      contains a list of frame numbers within the full ImageSeries of the first frame
      of each file listed in the parent 'external_file' dataset. Zero-based indexing
      is used (hence, the first element will always be zero). For example, if the
      'external_file' dataset has three paths to files and the first file has 5 frames,
      the second file has 10 frames, and the third file has 20 frames, then this attribute
      will have values [0, 5, 15]. If there is a single external file that holds all
      of the frames of the ImageSeries (and so there is a single element in the 'external_file'
      dataset), then this attribute should have value [0].

      is not present, then the default format='raw' case is assumed.
