# ndx-multichannel-volume Extension for NWB

This extension is to add support for volumetric multichannel images. This
extends existing NWB functions for optophysiology imaging to allow for 
3 dimensions and a flexible number of channels. There is additional support
for adding metadata that is necessary for imaging in C. Elegans.

## Installation

To install this package on Unix/macOS, run in command line
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps ndx-multichannel-volume

On windows, run 

py -m pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps ndx-multichannel-volume


## Usage

This extension is to add support for volumetric multichannel images. This 
extends existing NWB functions for optophysiology imaging to allow for 
3 dimensions and a flexible number of channels. There is additional support
for adding metadata that is necessary for imaging in C. Elegans. 

New classes added in this extension are:

CElegansSubject - extension of the base subject class with additional attributes
for metadata specific to C. Elegans.

MultiChannelVolumeSeries - extension of the base TimeSeries class to support 
multiple channels and 3 dimensions.

MultiChannelVolume - class for storing mutlichannel volumetric images with 
a flexible number of channels. 

ImagingVolume - alternate version of the native ImagingPlane class for supporting
metadata associated with volumetric multichannel images. Contains a list of optical
channel references as well as an ordered list of how those channels index to the 
channels in the image.

OpticalChannelPlus - extension of the OpticalChannel class to support additional
information including emission_range, excitation_range, and excitation_lambda.

OpticalChannelReferences - contains ordered list of optical channel to represent the 
order of the optical channels in the reference volume.

VolumeSegmentation - contains segmentation masks for image volumes. There are options 
to use either a standard voxel_mask with XYZ information as well as a Cell ID label,
or color_voxel_mask which has RGBW information as well as XYZ.
