[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/midiloop)](https://pypi.org/project/midiloop)
[![Build](https://github.com/fwcd/midiloop/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fwcd/midiloop/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A small utility that runs a virtual MIDI loopback device. This is useful for getting MIDI applications to talk to each other, e.g. [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org) and [QLC+](https://www.qlcplus.org).

## Usage

```sh
midiloop [-n NAME] [-v]
```
