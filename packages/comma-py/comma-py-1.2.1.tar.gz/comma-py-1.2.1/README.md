**comma** is a generic library for efficient processing of fixed-width
(comma-separated or binary) data mostly written in C++

**comma-py** is the part of **comma** written in python; the main part of
it is **csv-eval** command line utility for efficient **numpy**-style
conversions on an input stream of comma-separated or fixed-width binary
data.

**comma-py** also has useful modules for dictionary and signal manipulations.

for more details, run:
```
csv-eval --help --verbose
```
