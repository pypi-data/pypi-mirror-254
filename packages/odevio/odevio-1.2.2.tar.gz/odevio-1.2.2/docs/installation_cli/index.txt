Odevio is a CLI utility developed in Python. It is easily installed with pip.

.. code-block::

    pip install odevio


Once installed we can easily run the CLI in the terminal :code:`$ odevio` and you should get the ``help`` output of the terminal.

If it is your first time using Odevio, create an Odevio account by running :

.. code-block::

    odevio signup

.. note::

    PIP is the python package manager. PIP and python should be installed on your computer for Odevio to work.
    `Install python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

.. warning::

    python 3.6 or higher is required for Odevio to work properly.
