================================================
1. Create your first Odevio configuration build
================================================

If you are here, it means that you managed to install Odevio and have created your account.

You are almost there, this is the only step you need to do to create your first configuration build.

It is really easy, you just need to **use this one command**:

.. code-block::

  odevio build start

.. note::
    Make sure you are in the root folder of your app!

.. tip:: 
  You can always add ``--help`` to your command line to list all the options of the command. That way, you can see what your next action will be.

**Select the configuration type**

Now, select the **No application (Xcode will not be configured) option.**

.. note::
    If you have linked your Odevio account with your Apple Developer Account, you will be able to see a list of the Apps you added.

Once it is done, you will receive all the credentials of your Mac virtual machine.

Let's hop on to the next chapter of our tutorial to learn how to connect and setup Xcode for your build.

.. note::
    If you have an Apple developer account and App ID(s), check out our tutorial on  :doc:`how to link your account <6_configure_app_store_connect>` and 
    :doc:`how to create an app ID <7_how_to_make_an_app_id_using_odevio>` using Odevio.

.. tip::
    If the build fails you can easily access the logs of your build with the command ``odevio build logs`` and select
    the build for which you want to view the logs.

.. tip::
    If you closed your terminal while your app was building you can execute ``odevio build detail`` and select the last
    build and you will have a detailed view of the build's status. Builds do not stop if the ``odevio build start``
    command is killed.
