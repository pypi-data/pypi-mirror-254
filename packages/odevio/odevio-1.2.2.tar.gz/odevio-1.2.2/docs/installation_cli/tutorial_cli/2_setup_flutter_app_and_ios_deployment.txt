2. How to connect to your configuration build
=============================================

In this chapter, you will learn how to **connect to your configuration build**

Use RustDesk to connect to your configuration build
---------------------------------------------------

Now that your configuration build is ready and that you received your credentials, you can connect to your Mac virtual machine.

.. tip::
    If you try to connect a build that was not meant for remote desktop or that was stopped, no problem, 
    Odevio will suggest you to create one automatically.

For this step, you need a remote desktop access application. For Odevio, the one used is **RustDesk's** |rustdesk_client|.

Launch RustDesk, it should look like the following screenshot.

.. warning::
  **The first step is to click on the three little dots and select 'ID/Relay Server'.**

Type in Odevio's relay server: **odevio.com**

This step is to make sure you are connected to Odevio's relay server.

Secondly, simply enter the **RustDesk ID** you were given to authenticate.

Finally, RustDesk will ask you to enter the **RustDesk password** you received.

That's it ! You are now connected to an Odevio-Remote build machine in remote desktop.

.. tip::
    If you can not see the entire desktop, do not worry, there is a shrink option in the settings.
