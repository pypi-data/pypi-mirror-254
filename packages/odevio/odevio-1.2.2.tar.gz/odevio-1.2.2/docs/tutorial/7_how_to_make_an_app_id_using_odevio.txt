7. How to create an App ID using Odevio
========================================

What is an App ID (aka identifier) ?
------------------------------------

It is the combination of your **Team ID** and the **bundle ID**. The Team ID is the one you can find in your membership
information and is supplied by Apple. 

The bundle ID is the one you define and is a **unique identifier** for your app on
the App Store. The App ID is required to publish an app on the App Store.

.. note::
    The bundle id should look like this : **com.company.appname**

In Odevio, you can directly **manage your App IDs**. It is the purpose of the **Applications** tab.

.. note::
  If you are using the free trial or the hobbyist plan, you can only link **one** application to your user account.

  To **link multiple applications** to your user account, you have to **subscribe to Odevio**, check out our available plans |odevio_sub|.

Make a new App ID
-----------------

You can **create a new one** by clicking on the **+ New application** button in the top right corner.

**If it is your first application**, you will directly land on the **create a new app** page.

The **name** is simply the one you want to give to the identifier. Choose an app name to make your life easier.

The **bundle ID** (e.g.: com.yourcompany.yourapp)

.. note::
  If you have more than one developper account configured in Odevio you can select the one you want to use
  when creating a new app.

Let's check if your App ID was created properly on Apple Developer.

For that, go over to your |apple_developer_account|, then to the **"Certificates, Identifiers & Profile"** menu.

There, you will find the **"Identifiers menu"** that contains the list with the possibility to create new ones.

Modify your Bundle ID on the Odevio-Remote
-------------------------------------------

To modify your Bundle ID on Odevio remote, **you have to connect to a configuration build** just like we did in the :ref:`step 1 <start_configuration_build>` of our tutorial.

So, go to the **Builds** tab.

Select the configuration type.

.. note::
  Remember that your virtual machine will be up for an hour, so make sure you finish everything you need in that time.

We will **configure the Bundle Identifier in XCode for our app** to be the same as the one we created with Odevio otherwise
Apple will not accept our submission later on in the tutorial. In the left menu of XCode select **Runner** and in the
**Signing & Capacities** tab under Bundle Identifier you can find the field to change it.
