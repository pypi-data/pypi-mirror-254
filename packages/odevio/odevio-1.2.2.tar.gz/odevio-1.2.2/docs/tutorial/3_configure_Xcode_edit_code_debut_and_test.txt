Debug and test your Flutter app with the iOS simulator
------------------------------------------------------

Debugging and testing your iOS app is fairly easy with Odevio.

**Once you are on the Odevio-Remote**, an instance of the Simulator is ready for you.

You can **open the terminal** on the Odevio-Remote.

Go into your app using ``cd Documents/app`` and use the ``flutter run`` command.

Wait a few instants and the app should start on the simulator, you can now debug and test it.
