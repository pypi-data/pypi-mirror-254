9. How to publish a Flutter app on the App Store without a Mac
==============================================================

**Congratulations, you are almost done !**

For this last part of the tutorial, you will learn how to publish your Flutter iOS app on the App Store.

.. note:: 
  If you are using the free trial, you have access to unlimited successful publication builds **for 10 days** to release your app on the App Store.

  To **enjoy unlimited publication builds**, you must **upgrade to a paid subscription**. You can discover our paid plans |odevio_sub|.

Create your app in the App Store
--------------------------------

The first thing you will want to do is to create an iOS app on |app_store_connect|.

You can give whatever name you would like.

Select the **bundle ID** from the list of App ID you have created earlier in the tutorial.

If you have no app ID, you can refer to the :ref:`chapter 7 <create_app_id>` of this tutorial.

Finally, for **SKU** you can choose anything you want as long as it is unique.

You now have access to a dashboard for your app. If you scroll down, you will see the **Build** section.

Build your app
--------------

Now that this done, go over the client and go in the **Builds* tab.

And this time, for the build type: **publication**

Wait for Odevio to create and start the build.

.. tip::
  Do not forget to adjust your app version or build number to avoid duplicate errors


Publish your app on the App Store
---------------------------------

The **build section** should now look like this and you can **select your newest build**.

Apple will ask you if your app responds to **encryption standards** and other standards **you have to comply to**.

**You did it!** Your build has been **successfully publish** on the app store.

.. warning:: **Do not forget to save your build!**

For your app to be published on the app store, you still have to **complete any missing information** and then
you can submit it to Apple for review.

.. tip:: This type of build can also be published on TestFlight for more testing.

Usually it takes Apple a few days to test your application and approve it or decline it. In case it is declined you will
get an e-mail from Apple telling you why it is not approved (reasons are not always very specific). You can then fix
the issues and publish it again.
