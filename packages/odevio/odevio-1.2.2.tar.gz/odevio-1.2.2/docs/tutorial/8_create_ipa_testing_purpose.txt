8. How to create an IPA file for testing purposes on an Apple Device
====================================================================

In this section of the tutorial, you are going to learn how to effectively build your app to retrieve the **IPA** file
for testing purposes on physical Apple devices.

.. tip:: An IPA file contains an iOS app. It is a file that can be installed on iOS devices and used as an application.
         It is comparable to an Android APK.

Adding your device to Apple Developer
-------------------------------------

IPA files can be used for testing purposes only if the physical devices on which you want to test them are added to the
Apple Developer Devices.

To register a new device, visit |apple_device| and add a new device.

You will need the UDID of the apple device on which you want to install your app. You can get the UDID by browsing
to `udid.tech <https://udid.tech/>`_ with your apple device. Or you can get your UDID
`directly from itunes <https://whatsmyudid.com/>`_ when your device is plugged in.

Once your device has been registered we can start building the IPA.

Building the IPA
----------------
You can use the **Builds** tab but this time the **build type** is going to be **ad-hoc**. Select your app in your list of proposed apps.

You will be given a URL. If you use it in a browser, it will download the file.

Or just scan the QR code with an iPhone.

You can also send the URL to a **registered device** of your Apple developer account to download the app, for example by e-mail.
When clicking this link directly from your Apple device a prompt will be shown to install the application on your device.

And that is how you can build your app for testing purposes on physical devices.

.. note:: 
  The previously used build type **configuration** for the Xcode configuration does not generate an IPA file.

.. tip:: 
  To register a new device, visit |apple_device|.

.. warning:: For the device to be used, it must be registered **before** you make the build. Otherwise,
             you will not be able to install the app.
