1. Create your first Odevio configuration build
================================================

If you are here, it means that you managed to install Odevio and have created your account.

You are almost there, this is the only step you need to do to create your first configuration build.

It is really easy, go to the **Builds** page:

.. tip:: 
  You can click on the little i's, it will redirect you to the reference guide and the field's definition

First, select the root folder of your app!

For this tutorial, you are not required to select an application (Xcode will not be configured).

.. note::
    If you have linked your Odevio account with your Apple Developer Account, you will be able to see a list of the Apps you added.

**Select the configuration type**

Make sure you specify the Flutter version you have installed aswell.

    :doc:`how to create an app ID <7_how_to_make_an_app_id_using_odevio>` using Odevio.
