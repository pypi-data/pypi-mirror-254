    * **Development:** builds the app for testing on an iOS simulator.

    * **Ad-hoc:** Build an .ipa file for testing on  physical devices listed in your developer account. Check this |add_device| on how to add an iOS physical device to your account.

    * **Distribution:** Build an .ipa file that can be distributed on any device.

    * **Validation:** Build an .ipa file and validates that it can be released on the App Store.
