EXAMPLE USAGE
=============

calculate z score for weight vs age

.. code-block:: python

    from cgmzscore.src.main import z_score_wfa

    score = z_score_wfa(weight="7.853",age_in_days='16',sex='M')

calculate z score for weight vs length/height

.. code-block:: python

    from cgmzscore.src.main import z_score_wfl

    score = z_score_wfl(weight="7.853",age_in_days='16',sex='M',height='73')

calculate z score for weight vs length/height and both wfl and wfh works same

.. code-block:: python

    from cgmzscore.src.main import z_score_wfh

    score = z_score_wfh(weight="7.853",age_in_days='16',sex='M',height='73')

calculate z score for length vs age

.. code-block:: python

    from cgmzscore.src.main import z_score_lhfa

    score = z_score_lhfa(age_in_days='16',sex='M',height='73')

find child is SAM/MAM/Healthy

.. code-block:: python

    from cgmzscore.src.main import calculate_sam_mam

    score = calculate_sam_mam(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_days='16',sex='M',height='73')
