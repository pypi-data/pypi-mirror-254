# *stamina*: Production-grade Retries Made Easy

Transient failures are common in distributed systems.
To make your systems resilient, you need to **retry** failed operations.
But bad retries can make things *much worse*.

*stamina* is an opinionated wrapper around the great-but-unopinionated [Tenacity](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/) package.
Its goal is to be as **ergonomic** as possible while doing the **right thing by default** and minimizing the potential for **misuse**.
It is the result of years of copy-pasting the same configuration over and over again:

- Retry only on certain exceptions.
- Exponential **backoff** with **jitter** between retries.
- Limit the number of retries **and** total time.
- Automatic **async** support – including [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/).
- Preserve **type hints** of the decorated callable.
- Flexible **instrumentation** with [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python), [*structlog*](https://www.structlog.org/), and standard library's `logging` support out-of-the-box.
- Easy _global_ deactivation for testing.

For example:

```python
import httpx

import stamina


@stamina.retry(on=httpx.HTTPError, attempts=3)
def do_it(code: int) -> httpx.Response:
    resp = httpx.get(f"https://httpbin.org/status/{code}")
    resp.raise_for_status()

    return resp
```

<!-- end docs index -->

**Async** callables work use the same API and it's possible to retry **arbitrary blocks**, too.
Check out our [tutorial](https://stamina.hynek.me/en/latest/tutorial.html) for more examples!



## Release Information

### Added

- `stamina.RetryingCaller` and `stamina.AsyncRetryingCaller` that allow even easier retries of single callables: `stamina.RetryingCaller(attempts=5).on(ValueError)(do_something, "foo", bar=42)` and `stamina.RetryingCaller(attempts=5)(ValueError, do_something, "foo", bar=42)` will call `do_something("foo", bar=42)` and retry on `ValueError` up to 5 times.

  `stamina.RetryingCaller` and `stamina.AsyncRetryingCaller` take the same arguments as `stamina.retry()`, except for `on` that can be bound separately.
