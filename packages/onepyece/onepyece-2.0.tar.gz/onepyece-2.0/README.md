## Description

Python **API wrapper** for https://api-onepiece.com/ \
Thank's to this package you can simply get informations about One Piece characters, fruits, crews, etc. The datas provided by the API are in french only for the moment. \
Learn more about possibilities in the [Usage](#usage) section. 

⚠️*This package is still in development and it's my very first python package, so it may not be stable.*

## Installation

**There are several solutions :**

- Use this command ``pip install onepyece`` to get it from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/onepyece/)
- Use this command ``pip install git+https://github.com/icepick4/onepyece`` to download it from this repo.
- Download either the .zip or the tar.gz archive from the last release and then use this command `` pip install <path_to_archive> ``

## Usage

```py
>>> import onepyece as op
>>> sanji = op.character_by_name('sanji') # You can get a character by its name
>>> sanji.birthday
'2000-03-02'
>>> nb_fruits = op.count_fruits() # You can get the count of a specific endpoint
>>> nb_fruits.count
197
>>> nb_fruits.url
https://api.api-onepiece.com/fruits/count
>>> crews = op.API('crews') # List of all the crews in dict form as you can see below
>>> crews[0]
API(object={'endpoint': None, 'search_term': None, 'resource': None, 'object': True, 'id': 1, 'french_name': 'L’équipage du Chapeau de Paille', 'roman_name': 'Mugiwara no Ichimi', 'description': '', 'total_prime': '3.161.000.100', 'number': '10', 'status': 'actif', 'isYonko': True, 'affiliation': ''})
