Fusion Model Templates
=======================

Do you know a fusion model that isn't listed here? Please consider contributing it to the project!

The below templates will walk you through how to add a fusion model so that it works with the rest of ``fusilli``.

Even if your model is subspace-based or graph-based, I would still recommend going through the general fusion template first, as it will help you understand the structure of the project.

Have fun! ðŸŒ¸
