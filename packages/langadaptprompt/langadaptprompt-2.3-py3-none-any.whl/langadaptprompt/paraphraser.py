PARAPHRASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = 'You are a helpful assistant who is an expert on Euclidean geometry. Given a problem and a list of steps leading to its solution, your task is to come up with a problem different to the one given, that involves a similar logic and series of steps. Paraphrase variable names, and also come up with a problem that might require 2 more steps for its solution. The steps must include the geometric tools that are mentioned, do not add any new tools. If you need to include new tools try to use steps with a current tool to lead to the same result (e.g a perpendicular bisector can be done by using circle tool twice and the line tool at the circles intersection)'
PARAPHRASE_USER_PROMPT = "Description: Construct an equilateral triangle with the given side. The construction must be exact. Guessing even very close points does not count as a solution.Let A and B be the two end points of the given segment.\nAvailable Tools:\n['Circle Tool', 'Line Tool', 'Intersection Tool']\nSolution:\n<Circle Tool>Construct a circle with center A and radius AB\n<Circle Tool>Construct a circle with center B and radius AB, intersecting circle A at points C and D\n<Line Tool>Construct line AC\n<Line Tool>Construct line BC"
