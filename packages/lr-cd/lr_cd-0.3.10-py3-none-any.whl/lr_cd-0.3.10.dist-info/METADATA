## Project Summary

We implement linear regression using the coordinate descent (CD) algorithm in this Python package. Here are additional details about the [coordinate descent (CD) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent).

## Functions

There are three functions in this package:

**1. Simulated data generation:** 

`generate_data_lr(n, n_features, theta, noise=0.2, random_seed=123)`: generates random data points based on the theta coefficients, which can be used for model fitting.

**2. Coordinate descent algorithm:**

 `coordinate_descent(X, y, ϵ=1e-6, max_iterations=1000)`: performs coordinate descent to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of linear regression and outputs the optimized intercept and coefficients vector.

**3. Visualization of data and the fitted linear regression:**
 
 `plot_lr(X, y, intercept, coef)`:  returns a scatter plot of the observed data points overlayed with a regression with optimized intercept and coefficients vector.

## Common Parameters

- `n` (integer): Number of data points users want to generate.
- `n_features` (integer): Number of features to generate, excluding the intercept.
- `theta` (ndarray): True scalar intercept and coefficient weights vector. The first element should always be the intercept.
- `noise` (float): Standard deviation of a normal distribution added to the generated target y array as noise.
- `random_seed` (integer): Random seed to ensure reproducibility.
- `X` (ndarray): Feature data matrix, the independent variable.
- `y` (ndarray): Response data vector, the dependent variable. Both `X` and `y` should have the same number of observations.
- `ϵ` (float, optional): Stop the algorithm if the change in weights is smaller than the value (default is 1e-6).
- `max_iterations` (integer, optional): Maximum number of iterations (default is 1000).
- `intercept` (float): Optimized intercept. 
- `coef` (ndarray): Optimized coefficient weights vector. 

## Python Ecosystem Context

**lr_cd** establishes a valuable enhancement to the Python ecosystem. The `LinearRegression` in the Python package `scikit-learn` has similar functionality, but our implementation uses a different algorithm, which we believe is better. [`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares) contains a few optimization functions: `scipy.linalg.lstsq`, `scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr`, and `scipy.optimize.nnls`, which rely on the singular value decomposition of feature matrix `X`.

- **Beginner-Friendly** : `lr_cd` is easy to use for beginners in Python and statistics. The well-written functions allow users to play with various simulated data and generate beautiful plots with little effort.

- **Reliable-Alternative** : The coordinate descent algorithm is known for fast convergence in various convex optimization problems, making this Python package a reliable alternative to existed packages. Current package can be easily extended to a list of statistical models such as Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure Miniconda or Anaconda is installed on your system

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:UBC-MDS/lr_cd.git
cd lr_cd  # Navigate to the cloned repository directory
```

#### Step 2: Create and Activate the Conda Environment

```bash
# Method 1: create Conda Environment from the environment.yml file
conda env create -f environment.yml  
conda activate lr_cd  

# Method 2: create Conda Environment from scratch
conda create --name lr_cd python=3.9 -y
conda activate lr_cd
```

#### Step 3: Install the Package Using Poetry

Ensure the Conda environment is activated (you should see (lr_cd) in the terminal prompt)

```bash
poetry install  # Install the package using Poetry
```

#### Step 4: Get the coverage

```bash
# Check line coverage
pytest --cov=lr_cd

# Check branch coverage
pytest --cov-branch --cov=lr_cd
poetry run pytest --cov-branch --cov=src
poetry run pytest --cov-branch --cov=lr_cd --cov-report html
```

#### Troubleshooting

1. Environment Creation Issues: Ensure environment.yml is in the correct directory and you have the correct Conda version

2. Poetry Installation Issues: Verify Poetry is correctly installed in the Conda environment and your pyproject.toml file is properly configured

## Usage

Use this package to find the optimized intercept and coefficients vector of linear regression. In the following example, we generate a simulated data set with a feature matrix and response first. By the coordinate descent algorithm, we obtain the optimized intercept and coefficients. Finally, we visualize both the simulated data and fitted line in one figure.

Example usage:

```python
>>> from lr_cd.lr_data_generation import generate_data_lr
>>> import numpy as np
>>> theta = np.array([4, 3])
>>> X, y = generate_data_lr(n=10, n_features=1, theta=theta)
>>> print(f"Generated X: {X}")
>>> print(f'Generated y: {y}')
```

```

```

```python
>>> from lr_cd.lr_plotting import plot_lr
>>> plot_lr(X, y, intercept, coef)
```
