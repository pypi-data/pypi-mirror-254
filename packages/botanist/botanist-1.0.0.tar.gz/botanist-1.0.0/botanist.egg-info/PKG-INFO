		<p>
			This is the generic library that is used by "body_scan"
			and it should really only be used by "body_scan".
			
			As well, the checks in the this one should not utilize
			"body_scan", and instead should use "pytest" or "unit test".
			
			For a more advanced library that is maintained with "body_scan",
			there is "botany".
