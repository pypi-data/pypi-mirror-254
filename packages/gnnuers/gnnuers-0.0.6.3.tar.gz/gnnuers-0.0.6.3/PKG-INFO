Description: 
        GNNUERS generates explanations in the form of user-item interactions that make
        a GNN-based recommender system favor a demographic group over another. GNNUERS learns a perturbation
        vector that modifies the adjacency matrix representing the training network. The edges modified by
        the perturbation vector are the explanations genereated by the framework. GNNUERS then needs to work on a slight
        extended version of a recommender system in order to include the perturbation vector and optimize it.
