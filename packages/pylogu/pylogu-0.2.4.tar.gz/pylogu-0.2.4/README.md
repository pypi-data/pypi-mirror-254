# Simple Usage
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Logu Client
```python
from pylogu import Logu
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize the Logu client
```python
logu = Logu(LOGU_API_KEY, LOGU_PROJECT, LOGU_CHANNEL)
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Using the 'log' function
```python
logu.log(LOGU_EVENT, LOGU_ICON)
# logu.log(LOGU_PROJECT, LOGU_CHANNEL, LOGU_EVENT, LOGU_ICON)
```

## üôã Using the 'identify' function
```python
logu.identify(LOGU_USER_ID, LOGU_USER_PROPERTIES)
# logu.identify(LOGU_PROJECT, LOGU_USER_ID, LOGU_USER_PROPERTIES)
```

## üí° Using the 'insight' function
```python
logu.insight(LOGU_INSIGHT, LOGU_ICON, LOGU_INSIGHT_VALUE)

# Usage Example
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Logu Client
```python
from pylogu import Logu
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize the Logu client
```python
logu = Logu(
    key=LOGU_API_KEY,
    project=LOGU_PROJECT,

)
print("Log Response:", log_response)
```

## üôã Using the 'identify' function
```python
identify_response = logu.identify(
    # project=LOGU_PROJECT || None,
    # project is required, but optional if you initiated the client with a project
    user_id=LOGU_USER_ID,
    properties=LOGU_USER_PROPERTIES
)
print("Identify Response:", identify_response)
```

## üí° Using the 'insight' function
```python
insight_response = logu.insight(
  # project=LOGU_PROJECT || None,
    # project is required, but optional if you initiated the client with a project
    insight=LOGU_INSIGHT,
