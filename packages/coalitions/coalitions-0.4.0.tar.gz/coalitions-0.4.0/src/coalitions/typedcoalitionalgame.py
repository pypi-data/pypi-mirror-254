      the value of a coalition depends on the number of types of each player.
      If all players are unique, there is just one player of each type.
      I represent the player types as a dict e.g. {'a': 3, 'b', 4 } means there are 3 players of type a and
      4 of type b.
      The coalition valuation function takes a coalition tuple as an input. Internally it will
      usually just be a dictionary lookup with the coalition tupe as a key. The keys must be sorted since
      (('a',3), ('b',4)) and (('b', 4), ('a',3)) are not the same.
