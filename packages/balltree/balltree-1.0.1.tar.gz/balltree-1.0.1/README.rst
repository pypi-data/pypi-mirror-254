A fast ball tree implementation for three dimensional (weighted) data with an
Euclidean distance norm. The base implementation is in `C` and there is a
wrapper for `Python`.

The tree is optimised towards spatial correlation function calculations since
the query routines are geared towards range queries, i.e. counting pairs with a
given (range of) separations. Fixed number nearest neighbour search is currently
not implemented.

Installation
------------

A `C` library can be built with the provided make file, the python wrapper is
automatically compiled and installed with ``pip install balltree``.

The installation does not require any external `C` libraries, the python wrapper
requires the ``Python.h`` header (which should be included in a default python
installation) and `numpy` (including ``numpy/arrayobject.h``).
