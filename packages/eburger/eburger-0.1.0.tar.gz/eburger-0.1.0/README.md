## How it looks like

Here's a demo video

https://github.com/forefy/eburger/assets/152717707/65bf6a6d-adbc-4664-84d4-73ac641a8307

Besides `eburger-output.json`, above example will also generate extended info under the folder `.eburger`.


## How to install
These commands will make `eburger` available from anywhere:
```
git clone https://github.com/forefy/eburger.git
cd eburger
pip3 install .
eburger -h
```

## How to run

### Simple examples
Simplest:
```bash
cd MyProject/
eburger
cat eburger-output.json
```
..

A focused scan of one file and it's dependencies:
```
eburger -f ../ProjectToScan/src/SomeContract.sol
```
..


### Advanced usage
Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/forefy/eburger/wiki/Advanced-usage).


## Adding templates
Templates can be added by creating new YAML files and either load them with `eburger -t mytemplate.yaml .` or by placing them under the `templates/` directory.

If you are using eburger as a python package (installed via pip install), the templates location can be found with running `pip3 show eburger` or by running the tool on a contract and seeing the templates path printed to the console.

For documentation refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/forefy/eburger/wiki/Templates).
