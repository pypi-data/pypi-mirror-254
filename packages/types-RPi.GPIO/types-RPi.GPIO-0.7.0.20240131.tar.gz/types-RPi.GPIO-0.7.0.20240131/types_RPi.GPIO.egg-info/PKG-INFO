## Typing stubs for RPi.GPIO

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`RPi.GPIO`](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/code/) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`RPi.GPIO`.

This version of `types-RPi.GPIO` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `RPi.GPIO==0.7.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/RPi.GPIO. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `0f524217d62e43d751c189d04ab8d3623a60f992` and was tested
with mypy 1.8.0, pyright 1.1.342, and
pytype 2023.12.18.
