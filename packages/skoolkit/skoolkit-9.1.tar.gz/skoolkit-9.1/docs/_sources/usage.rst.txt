Installing and using SkoolKit
=============================

Requirements
------------
SkoolKit requires `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ 3.8+. If you're running
Linux or one of the BSDs, you probably already have Python installed. If you're
running Windows, you can get Python `here <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_.

Installation
------------
There are various ways to install the latest stable release of SkoolKit:

* from the zip archive or tarball available at `skoolkit.ca`_
* from the zip archive or tarball available at `GitHub`_
* from `PyPI`_ by using `pip`_

If you choose the zip archive or tarball, note that SkoolKit can be used
wherever it is unpacked: it does not need to be installed in any particular
location.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/skoolkit/
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/

Linux/\*BSD v. Windows command line
-----------------------------------
Throughout this documentation, commands that must be entered in a terminal
window ('Command Prompt' in Windows) are shown on a line beginning with a
dollar sign (``$``), like this::

  $ some-script.py some arguments

On Windows, and on Linux/\*BSD if SkoolKit has been installed as a Python
package (using 'pip'), the commands may be entered exactly as they are shown.
On Linux/\*BSD, use a dot-slash prefix (e.g. ``./some-script.py``) if the
script is being run from the current working directory.
