PyChemia is an open-source Python Library for materials structural
search. The purpose of the initiative is to create a method agnostic
framework for materials discovery and design using a variety of methods
from Minima Hoping to Soft-computing based methods. PyChemia is also a
library for data-mining, using several methods to discover interesting
candidates among the materials already processed.

The core of the library is the Structure python class, it is able to
describe periodic and non-periodic structures. As the focus of this
library is structural search the class defines extensive capabilities to
modify atomic structures.

The library includes capability to read and write in several ab-initio
codes. At the level of DFT, PyChemia support VASP, ABINIT and Octopus.
At Tight-binding level development is in process to support DFTB+ and
Fireball. This allows the library to compute electronic-structure
properties using state-of-the-art ab-initio software packages and
extract properties from those calculations.

Installation
============

You can install pychemia in several ways. We are showing 3 ways of
installing PyChemia inside a Virtual environment. A virtual environment
is a good way of isolating software packages from the pacakges installed
with the Operating System. The decision on which method to use
depends if you want to use the most recent code or the package uploaded
from time to time to PyPi. The last method is particularly suited for
developers who want to change the code and get those changes operative without
an explicit instalation.


Installing with pip from pypi.org on a virtual environment
----------------------------------------------------------

This method installs PyChemia from the packages uploaded
to PyPi every month. It will provides a version of
PyChemia that is stable.

First, create and activate the virtual environment.
We are using the name ``pychemia_ve``, but that is arbitrary.

::

    python3 -m venv pychemia_ve
    source pychemia_ve/bin/activate


When the virtual environment is activated, your prompt
changes to ``(pychemia_ve)...$``. Now, install pychemia
with pip

::

    python3 -m pip install pychemia


Installing with pip from a cloned repo on a virtual environment
---------------------------------------------------------------

This method installs PyChemia from the Github repo.
The method will install PyChemia from the most recent sources.

First, create and activate the virtual environment.
We are using the name ``pychemia_ve``, but that is arbitrary.

::

    python3 -m venv pychemia_ve
    cd pychemia_ve
    source bin/activate

Second, clone the repository from GitHub

::

    git clone https://github.com/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia.git


Finally, install from the repo folder

::

    python3 -m pip install PyChemia


Using PyChemia from repo folder on a virtual environment
--------------------------------------------------------

This method is mostly used for development.
In this way PyChemia is not actually installed and changes to the code
will take inmediate effect.

First, create and activate the virtual environment.
We are using the name ``pychemia_ve``, but that is arbitrary.

::

    python3 -m venv pychemia_ve
    cd pychemia_ve
    source bin/activate


Clone the repository

::

    git clone https://github.com/MaterialsDiscovery/PyChemia.git


Go to repo folder, install Cython with pip and
execute ``setup.py`` to build the Cython modules.

::

    cd PyChemia
    python3 -m pip install Cython
    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
    python3 setup.py build


Finally, install the packages required for PyChemia to work

::

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


Set the variable ``$PYTHONPATH`` to point to PyChemia folder, in the case of bash it will be:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=`path`


On C shell (csh or tcsh)

::
    
    setenv PYTHONPATH `path`


To run the internal testsuite install ``pytest``

::

    python3 -m pip install pytest


Execute the testsuite:

::

    pytest


The output of the testsuite looks like this:

::
