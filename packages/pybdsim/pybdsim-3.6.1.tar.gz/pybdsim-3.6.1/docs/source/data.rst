Data Loading
============

Utilities to load BDSIM output data. This is intended for optical function plotting
and small scale data extraction - not general analysis of BDSIM output.


Loading ROOT Data
-----------------

pybdsim can load several different ROOT files produce by BDSIM, rebdsim, rebdsimCombine,
bdskim, rebdsimOptics, rebdsimHistoMerge. In all cases, the same function is used
but it may return a different pybdsim class representing the loaded data. ::
  
  >>> d = pybdsim.Data.Load("mylovelyfile.root")

In the case of a `rebdsim` file, an instance of the pybdsim.Data.RebdsimFile class
is returned (See `RebdsimFile`_). In the case of a raw BDSIM output file, an instance
of the BDSIM DataLoader analysis class is returned (even in Python).

.. note:: To load BDSIM raw data, the :code:`<bdsim-install-dir>/bin/bdsim.sh` script
	  must be sourced. This sets up environmental variables that ROOT requires to
	  load our shared libraries in C++ with definitions of the layout of the files
	  (i.e. the C++ classes). See also, :ref:`data-load-manual` for a method to
	  load the libraries yourself (normally automatic with :code:`Load()`).

Load Just Histograms
********************

It may be useful to load just the histograms on a computer with ROOT and pybdsim but
without BDSIM and all the libraries. In this case, we can use the RebdsimFile class
directly and flag that we should not try to load the BDSIM libraries. In this case,
it can only interpret native ROOT objects such as histograms and not the other data
in the file such as the beam line model (for plotting machine diagrams). ::


  >>> import pybdsim
  >>> d = pybdsim.Data.RebdsimFile("sample1.root", histogramsOnly=True)
  >>> d.histogramspy
  {'Event/PerEntryHistograms/PrimaryX': <pybdsim.Data.TH1 at 0x1549cef40>,

  'Event/PerEntryHistograms/D2XYEnergy': <pybdsim.Data.TH3 at 0x1550430d0>}



Looping Over Raw ROOT Data
--------------------------

We can loop over the raw BDSIM data easily with pybdsim. ::

  d = pybdsim.Data.Load("run1.root")
  eventTree = d.GetEventTree()

  for event in eventTree:
      # now we have event.<branchname>.<variable>
      print(event.Eloss.n)


We can also get an index with enumeration: ::

  for i,event in eventTree:
      print(i, event.Eloss.n)




RebdsimFile
-----------

When a `rebdsim` output file is loaded, all histograms will be loaded into a dictionary
with their path inside the root file (i.e. in various folders) as a key. All histograms
are held in a member dictionary called `histograms`. Copies are also provided in
`histograms1d`, `histograms2d` and `histograms3d`.

.. figure:: figures/rebdsimFileMembers.png
	    :width: 100%
	    :align: center

For convenience we provide wrappers for the raw ROOT histogram classes that provide
easy access to the data in numpy format with simple matplotlib plotting called
`pybdsim.Data.TH1`, `TH2` and `TH3`. Shown below is loading of the example output
file `combined-ana.root` in `bdsim/examples/features/data`.

	    :width: 100%
	    :align: center


Skimming Data With Custom Filter
--------------------------------

The compiled tool :code:`bdskim` exists to select a subset of events from a BDSIM
raw output file. It produces another BDSIM raw output file but with fewer events
that pass a selection (like a selection used for a histogram). However, we may
want to make a more complex selection that simply isn't possible in a single
histogram selection line.

In this case, we can use a little analysis written in Python and use pybdsim to
help to 'skim' the file nicely for us. Below is an example: ::

  import pybdsim
  def MyCustomFilter(event):
      return 20.0 < event.Primary.energy[0] < 100.0
  SkimBDSIMFile("originalData.root", MyCustomFilter)

This will apply MyCustomFilter, which returns True only when the first primary in
the event has a total energy greater than 20.0 GeV and less than 100.0 GeV. Events
matching this criteria will be saved to a new BDSIM raw file called "originaData_skim.root".


Histogram Plotting
------------------

Loaded histograms that are wrapped in our pybdsim.Data.THX classes can be plotted::

   >>> pybdsim.Plot.Histogram1D(d.histogramspy['Event/PerEntryHistograms/EnergyLossManual'])

Note, the use of `d.histogramspy` for the wrapped set of histograms and not the raw ROOT
histograms.

	    :align: center


ROOT Histogram Operations
-------------------------

Loaded histograms from a rebdsim file are both wrapped in our pybdsim.Data.THX classes
for nice numpy arrays for easy plotting, but also we retain the original ROOT objects.

We can use the original ROOT objects to do many very useful things with the histogram,
then wrap it again for plotting.

#) Get the ROOT histogram from the loaded file in pybdsim
#) Manipulate that ROOT object
#) Wrap it yourself in a pybdsim.Data.THX class
#) Plot using pybdsim.Plot.Histogram...

e.g. ::

  >>> d = pybdsim.Data.Load("run1-ana.root") # a rebdsim output file
  >>> h1 = d.histograms['Event'/PerEntryHistograms/EnergyLossBeamline']
  >>> h1rebin = h1.Rebin(2, h1->GetName()+"_rebin2")
  >>> h1rebinpy = pybdsim.Data.TH1(h1rebin)
  >>> pybdsim.Plot.Histogram1D(h1rebinpy)

ROOT's histograms provide many (many...) functions. You can see them all at the ROOT
website (Look for "CERN ROOT TH1" in google) or TH2 or TH3:

* https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH1.html
* https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH2D.html
* https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH3D.html

TH1 is, perhaps nonintuitively, the base class for 2D and 3D histograms, so many functions
are documented there. The 2D and 3D ones have some specialised methods.

.. note:: The integral and its error are nicely provided as members in pybdsim.Data.THXD.
	  Also, you can use the pybdsim.Plot.Histogram... functions with a scaling parameter
	  for the data.

Some useful functions assuming a histogram :code:`h` of type TH1D or TH2D or TH3D in Python:

**TH1**

* :code:`hnew = h.Rebin(N,h.GetName()+"_rebin"+str(N))` Join N bins into 1. e.g. Rebin(2) is merge 2 bins into 1.
* :code:`h.Add(h2)` Changes :code:`h` by adding h2 to it.
* :code:`h.Add(h2, -1)` Changes :code:`h` by subtracting h2 from it.
* :code:`h.Divide(h2)` Change :code:`h` to h divided by h2.
* :code:`h.Multiply(h2)` Change :code:`h` to h times h2.
* :code:`h.Scale(number)` Change :code:`h` to multiply every bin by 'number'.


**TH2**

* :code:`hnew = h.Rebin2D(Nx, Ny, h.GetName()+"_rebin"+str(Nx)+str(Ny))` Join Nx bins in x and Ny bins in y into 1.
* :code:`h.Scale(number)` Change :code:`h` to multiply every bin by 'number'.
* :code:`h.ProjectionX(h.GetName()+"_int_x", 0, -1, "e")` Integrate along the x dimension giving a 1D histogram in y.
* :code:`h.ProjectionY(h.GetName()+"_int_y", 0, -1, "e")` Integrate along the y dimension giving a 1D histogram in y.
  

**TH3**

* :code:`h.Scale(number)` Change :code:`h` to multiply every bin by 'number'.
* :code:`h2d = h.Project3D("yxe")` Integrate along z to give a TH2D x,y histogram and calculate errors ('e').
  https://root.cern.ch/doc/v608/classTH3.html#a94dd0a21d42fd95756e906e7f50fa293

  e.g. a 3D scoring mesh in x,y,z has N bins z = 1. We 'project' (i.e. integrate) in z given the same
  answer (only function available in ROOT) to get a 2D xy histogram. We want the errors to be calculated
  too rather than be 0.

  >>> h3d_raw = d.histograms['Event/MergedHistograms/MyScoringMeshName']
  >>> h2d = h3d_raw.Project3D("yxe")
  >>> h2dpy = pybdsim.Data.TH2(h2d)
  >>> pybdsim.Plot.Histogram2D(h2dphy)

* :code:`h1d = h.ProjectionZ()` Integrate x and y to give a 1D histogram in z.

  e.g. a 3D scoring mesh in x,y,z has only 1 bin in x and y, but N in Z. We use this function to
  reduce it to the 1D histogram it effectively is.

  >>> h3d_raw = d.histograms['Event/MergedHistograms/PhantomDose']
  >>> h1d = h3d_raw.ProjectionZ()
  >>> h1py = pybdsim.Data.TH1(h1d)
  >>> pybdsim.Plot.Histogram1D(h1py)


**ROOT Jargon**

* "Profile" histogram is an average in 1 dimension, not a 'profile' as per the real meaning of the word.
* "Projection" means integral.

Python Histogram Operations
---------------------------

Some of the above operations are provided in functions of `pybdsim.Data.TH2` and `pybdsim.Data.TH3` -
the 'Python' versions in pybdsim.

See :ref:`pybdsim-data-module` and look for each of the classes there, where their functions are listed.

Some specifically for 3D histograms (i.e. often scoring meshes) are described below.

.. _data-3d-histograms:
  
3D Scoring Histograms
---------------------

When using scoring in BDSIM, 3D histograms are produced for 3D scoring meshes. In pybdsim,
we have a few extra functions to help handle and inspect these. Plotting 3D is inherently
difficult because it has to be viewed from multiple angles to be understood. A few small
utility functions are provided to get individual slices and integrals along each dimension
to save the user from the difficultly of using underlying ROOT histograms.

The functions are members of an instance of :code:`pybdsim.Data.TH3`, the Python
version of the histogram.

* :code:`pybdsim.Data.TH3.IntegrateAlong1Dimension`
* :code:`pybdsim.Data.TH3.IntegrateAlong2Dimensions`
* :code:`pybdsim.Data.TH3.Slice2DXY`
* :code:`pybdsim.Data.TH3.Slice2DXZ`
* :code:`pybdsim.Data.TH3.Slice2DXY`

Examples:

::
  
   h3d # assume an pybdsim.Data.TH3 instance


::
   
   h2dx = h3d.IntegrateAlong1Dimension('x')  # return type pybdsim.Data.TH2
   pybdsim.Plot.Histogram2D(h2dx)


::
  
   for i in range(h3d.nbinsz):
       h2i = h3d.Slice2DXY(i)
       pybdsim.Plot.Histogram2D(h2i)


::
   
   h1dz = h3d.IntegrateAlong2Dimension('z')
   pybdsim.Plot.Histogram1D(h1dz)


Full documentation can be seen in the TH3 class documentation in the :ref:`pybdsim-data-module`
documentation.
  


.. _data-load-manual:

Manually Loading Raw Data
-------------------------

We can use ROOT direct if you prefer. ::

  import ROOT
  import pybdsim

  pybdsim.Data.LoadROOTLibraries()
  # this imports all of BDSIM's analysis classes and puts them inside ROOT

  # we need to know the BDSIM C++ classes we want by name
  d = ROOT.DataLoader("run1.root")
  # now the same as pybdsim.Data.Load("run1.root")

  model = pybdsim.Data.GetModelForPlotting(d)
  
  


Sampler Data
------------

.. warning:: This is a simplified way of loading sampler data that "flattens" the
	     structure losing all concept of which coordinate belongs to which event.
	     This is not recommend, and this may perhaps not be efficient, but it is
	     occasionally useful. If you want to make a histogram, use rebdsim. Only
	     with this will the error bars be correct.

Sampler data can be trivially extracted from a raw BDSIM output file ::

  >>> import pybdsim
  >>> d = pybdsim.Data.Load("output.root")
  >>> primaries = pybdsim.Data.SamplerData(d)

The optional second argument to `SamplerData` can be either the index of the sampler
as counting from 0 including the primaries, or the name of the sampler. ::

  >>> fq15x = pybdsim.Data.SamplerData(d, fq15x)
  >>> thirdAfterPrimares = pybdsim.Data.SamplerData(d, 3)

A near-duplicate class exists called `PhaseSpaceData` that can extract only the
variables most interesting for tracking ('x','xp','y','yp','z','zp','energy','t'). ::

  >>> psd1 = pybdsim.Data.PhaseSpaceData(d)
  >>> psd2 = pybdsim.Data.PhaseSpaceData(d, fq15x)
  >>> psd3 = pybdsim.Data.PhaseSpaceData(d, 3)
