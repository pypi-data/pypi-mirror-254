# PEtab Select

The repository for the development of the extension to PEtab for model
selection, including the additional file formats and Python 3 package.

## Install

The Python 3 package provides both the Python 3 and command-line (CLI)
interfaces, and can be installed from PyPI, with `pip3 install petab-select`.

## Documentation

Further documentation is available at
[http://petab-select.readthedocs.io/](http://petab-select.readthedocs.io/).

## Examples

There are example Jupyter notebooks for usage of PEtab Select with

- the command-line interface, and
- the Python 3 interface,

in the `doc/examples` directory.

## Supported features

### Criterion

- `AIC`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion#Definition
- `AICc`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion#Modification_for_small_sample_size
- `BIC`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion#Definition

### Methods

- `forward`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression#Main_approaches
- `backward`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression#Main_approaches
- `brute_force`: Optimize all possible model candidates, then return the model
  with the best criterion value.
- `famos`: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007230

Note that the directional methods (forward, backward) find models with the
smallest step size (in terms of number of estimated parameters). For example,
given the forward method and a predecessor model with 2 estimated parameters,
if there are no models with 3 estimated parameters, but some models with 4
estimated parameters, then the search may return candidate models with 4
estimated parameters.

## File formats

Column or key names that are surrounding by square brackets
(e.g. `[constraint_files]`) are optional.

### Selection problem

A YAML file with a description of the model selection problem.

```yaml
format_version: [string]
criterion: [string]
method: [string]
model_space_files: [List of filenames]
[constraint_files]: [List of filenames]
[predecessor_model_files]: [List of filenames]
```

- `format_version`: The version of the model selection extension format (
  e.g. `'beta_1'`)
- `criterion`: The criterion by which models should be compared (e.g. `'AIC'`)
- `method`: The method by which model candidates should be generated
  (e.g. `'forward'`)
- `model_space_files`: The filenames of model space files.
- `constraint_files`: The filenames of constraint files.
- `predecessor_model_files`: The filenames of predecessor (initial) model
  files.

### Model space

A TSV with candidate models, in compressed or uncompressed format.

| `model_subspace_id` | `petab_yaml` | [`sbml`] | `parameter_id_1`                                     | ... | `parameter_id_n`                                     |
|---------------------|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----|------------------------------------------------------|
| (Unique) [string]   | [string]     | [string] | [string/float] OR [; delimited list of string/float] | ... | [string/float] OR [; delimited list of string/float] |

- `model_subspace_id`: An ID for the model subspace.
- `petab_yaml`: The PEtab YAML filename that serves as the base for a model.
- `sbml`: An SBML filename. If the PEtab YAML file specifies multiple SBML
  models, this can select a specific model by model filename.
- `parameter_id_1`...`parameter_id_n` : Parameter IDs that are specified to
  take specific values or be estimated. Example valid values are:
    - uncompressed format:
        - `0.0`
        - `1.0`
        - `estimate`
    - compressed format
        - `0.0;1.1;estimate` (the parameter can take the values `0.0` or `1.1`,
          or be estimated according to the PEtab problem)

### Constraints

A TSV file with constraints.

| `petab_yaml` | [`if`]                       | `constraint`                 |
|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [string]     | [SBML L3 Formula expression] | [SBML L3 Formula expression] |

- `petab_yaml`: The filename of the PEtab YAML file that this constraint
  applies to.
- `if`: As a single YAML can relate to multiple models in the model space file,
  this ensures the constraint is only applied to the models that match
  this `if` statement
- `constraint`: If a model violates this constraint, it is skipped during the
  model selection process and not optimized.

### Model(s) (Predecessor models / model interchange / report)

- *Predecessor models* are used to initialize an appropriate model selection
  method. Model IDs should be unique here and compared to model IDs in any
  model space files.
- *Model interchange* refers to the format used to transfer model information
  between PEtab Select and a PEtab-compatible calibration tool, during the
  model selection process.
- *Report* refers to the final results of the model selection process, which may
  include calibration results from any calibrated models, or just the select
  model.

Here, the format for a single model is shown. Multiple models can be specified
as a YAML list of the same format.

The only required key is the PEtab YAML, as a model requires a PEtab problem.
All other keys are maybe required, for the different uses of the format (e.g.,
the report format should include `estimated_parameters`), or at different
stages of the model selection process (the PEtab-compatible calibration tool
should provide `criteria` for model comparison).

```yaml
[criteria]: [Dictionary of criterion names and values]
[estimated_parameters]: [Dictionary of parameter IDs and values]
[model_hash]: [string]
[model_id]: [string]
[parameters]: [Dictionary of parameter IDs and values]
petab_yaml: [string]
[predecessor_model_hash]: [string]
[sbml]: [string]
```

- `criteria`: The value of the criterion by which model selection was
  performed, at least. Optionally, other criterion values too.
- `estimated_parameters`: Parameter estimates, not only of parameters specified
  to be estimated in a model space file, but also parameters specified to be
  estimated in the original PEtab problem of the model.
- `model_hash`: The model hash, generated by the PEtab Select library.
- `model_id`: The model ID.
- `model_subspace_id`: Same as in the model space files.
- `model_subspace_indices`: The indices that locate this model in its model
  subspace.
- `parameters`: The parameters from the problem (either values
  or `'estimate'`) (a specific combination from a model space file, but
  uncalibrated).
- `petab_yaml`: Same as in model space files.
- `predecessor_model_hash`: The hash of the model that preceded this model
  during the model selection process.
- `sbml`: Same as in model space files.

## Test cases

Several test cases are provided, to test the compatibility of a
PEtab-compatible calibration tool with different PEtab Select features.

The test cases are available in the `test_cases` directory, and are provided in
the model format.

<a name="test_case_0002">1</a>. Model `M1_0` differs from `M1_1` in three
parameters, but only 1 additional estimated parameter. The effect of this on
model selection criteria needs to be clarified. Test case 0006 is a duplicate
of 0002 that doesn't have this issue.

<a name="test_case_0007_and_0008">2</a>. Noise parameter is removed, noise is
fixed to `1`.

<a name="test_case_0009">3</a>. This is a computationally expensive problem to
solve. Developers can try a model selection initialized with the provided
predecessor model, which is a model start that reproducibly finds the expected
model. To solve the problem reproducibly <i>ab initio</i>, on the order of 100
random model starts are required. This test case reproduces the model selection
problem presented in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2016.01.002 .
