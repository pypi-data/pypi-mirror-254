⚠️⚠️⚠️ The `coernicus-marine-client` PyPI package is deprecated. Please use `copernicusmarine` instead ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Here is the link to the new pypi repository: [https://pypi.org/project/copernicusmarine/](https://pypi.org/project/copernicusmarine/)"
Or install it using the following command: `pip install copernicusmarine`

If you were using this deprecated version, you may also want to delete the following folders:

- `~/.copernicus-marine-client`
- `~/.cachier` (⚠️ Be carefull with this one as it can contains other stuffs unrelated to the `copernicus-marine-client` package !)

# Reason for the deprecation

The official version 1.0.0 of the package has been released and it has been decided to rename the package to `copernicusmarine`.
That way, the command will always be the same, no matter what interface you are using (python or CLI).
