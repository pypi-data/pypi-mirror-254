===============================================================================================

This project is dedicated to building a "Synthetic Human" which is 
called Kenzy for which we have assigned the female gender pronoun of 
"she". She has intent determination (`padatious <https://github.com/MycroftAI/padatious>`__) 
visual face recognition (`opencv/opencv <https://github.com/opencv/opencv>`__), 
speech transcription (`whisper <https://openai.com/research/whisper>`__), 
and speech synthesis (`speecht5 <https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5>`__)/(`festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`__).  
Kenzy is written in Python and is targeted primarily at locally hosted home devices.
