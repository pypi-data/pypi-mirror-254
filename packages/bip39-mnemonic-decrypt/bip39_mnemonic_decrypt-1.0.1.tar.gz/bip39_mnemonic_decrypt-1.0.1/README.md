# BIP39 Mnemonic Decrypt
Reference implementation of BIP-39: Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys

# Abstract

This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence – a group of easy to remember words – for the generation of deterministic wallets.

It consists of two parts: generating the mnenomic, and converting it into a binary seed. This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP-39 or similar methods.

# Installation

To install this library and its dependencies use:
