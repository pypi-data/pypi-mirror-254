class TargetOperation(Node):
    r"""
    Create information about the target for system time evolution.

    Nodes created with this function contain two types of information: the
    target gate for the system time evolution, and the projection operator
    that defines the subspace of interest for robustness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operator : np.ndarray or Tensor
         The target gate :math:`U_\mathrm{target}`. Must be a non-zero partial
         isometry.
    filter_function_projector : np.ndarray or None, optional
        The orthogonal projection matrix :math:`P` onto the subspace used for
        filter function calculations. If you provide a value then it must be
        Hermitian and idempotent. Defaults to the identity matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    Target
        The node containing the specified target information.

    See Also
    --------
    infidelity_pwc : Total infidelity of a system with a piecewise-constant Hamiltonian.
    infidelity_stf : Total infidelity of a system with a sampleable Hamiltonian.

    Notes
    -----
    The target gate :math:`U_\mathrm{target}` is a non-zero partial isometry,
    which means that it can be expressed in the form
    :math:`\sum_j \left|\psi_j\right>\left<\phi_j\right|`, where
    :math:`\left\{\left|\psi_j\right>\right\}` and
    :math:`\left\{\left|\phi_j\right>\right\}` both form (non-empty)
    orthonormal, but not necessarily complete, sets. Such a target represents
    a target state :math:`\left|\psi_j\right>` for each initial state
    :math:`\left|\phi_j\right>`. The resulting operational infidelity is 0
    if and only if, up to global phase, each initial state
    :math:`\left|\phi_j\right>` maps exactly to the corresponding final state
    :math:`\left|\psi_j\right>`.

    The filter function projector :math:`P` is an orthogonal projection
    matrix, which means that it satisfies :math:`P=P^\dagger=P^2`. The image
    of :math:`P` defines the set of initial states from which the calculated
    filter function measures robustness.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a target operation for the Pauli :math:`X` gate.

    >>> target_operation = graph.target(operator=np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]]))
    >>> target_operation
    <Target: operation_name="target", value_shape=(2, 2)>

class InfidelityPwc(Node):
    r"""
    Create the total infidelity of the given piecewise-constant system.

    Use this function to compute the sum of the operational infidelity (which
    measures how effectively the system achieves a target gate) and filter
    function values (which measure how robust the system evolution is to
    various perturbative noise processes). This total infidelity value
    provides a cost that measures how effectively and robustly a set of
    controls achieves a target operation.

    Note that the total infidelity returned by this function is at least zero,
    but might be larger than one (for example if the system is highly
    sensitive to one of the noise processes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    hamiltonian : Pwc
        The control Hamiltonian :math:`H_{\mathrm c}(t)`. You can provide
        either a single Hamiltonian or a batch of them.
    target : Target
        The object describing the target gate :math:`U_\mathrm{target}` and
        (optionally) the filter function projector :math:`P`. If you
        provide a batch of Hamiltonians, the function uses the same target
        for all the elements in the batch.
    noise_operators : list[np.ndarray or Tensor or Pwc] or None, optional
        The perturbative noise operators :math:`\{N_j(t)\}`. The operators
        in the list can either be single operators or batches of them. If
        any of the noise operators or the Hamiltonian are batches, the batch
        shapes must all be broadcastable. You can omit this list if there are
        no noises.
    name : str or None, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The total infidelity (operational infidelity plus filter function
        values) of the given system, with respect to the given target gate.
        If you provide a batch of Hamiltonians or noise operators, the
        function returns a batch of infidelities containing one infidelity
        for each Hamiltonian and list of noise operators in the input batches.

    Warnings
    --------
    The Hessian matrix cannot currently be calculated for a graph which includes
    an `infidelity_pwc` node if the `hamiltonian` has degenerate eigenvalues at
    any segment.

    See Also
    --------
    infidelity_stf : Corresponding operation for `Stf` Hamiltonians.
    target : Define the target operation of the time evolution.
    time_evolution_operators_pwc : Unitary time evolution operators for quantum systems with
        `Pwc` Hamiltonians.

    Notes
    -----
    The total system Hamiltonian is

    .. math:: H_{\mathrm c}(t) + \sum_j \beta_j(t) N_j(t),

    where :math:`\{\beta_j(t)\}` are small, dimensionless, stochastic
    variables.

    The total infidelity, as represented by this node, is the sum of the
    operational infidelity :math:`\mathcal{I}` and the filter functions
    :math:`\{F_j(0)\}` of each noise operator evaluated at zero frequency.

    The operational infidelity is

    .. math::
      \mathcal{I} = 1-\left|
        \frac{\mathrm{Tr} \left(U_\mathrm{target}^\dagger U(t)\right)}
        {\mathrm{Tr} \left(U_\mathrm{target}^\dagger U_\mathrm{target}\right)}
        \right|^2,

    where :math:`U(t)` is the unitary time evolution operator due to
    :math:`H_{\mathrm c}(t)`.

    The filter function for the noise operator :math:`N_j(t)` is a measure of
    robustness, defined at frequency :math:`f` as

    .. math::
      F_j(f) = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Tr}(P)} \mathrm{Tr} \left( P
        \mathcal{F} \left\{ \tilde N_j^\prime(t) \right\} \left[ \mathcal{F}
        \left\{ \tilde N^\prime (t) \right\} \right]^\dagger P \right),

    where :math:`\mathcal{F}` is the Fourier transform,
    :math:`\tilde N_j(t) \equiv U_c^\dagger(t) N_j(t) U_c(t)` is the
    toggling-frame noise operator, and
    :math:`\tilde N_j^\prime(t)\equiv
    \tilde N_j(t)-
    \frac{\mathrm{Tr}(P\tilde N_j(t)P)}{\mathrm{Tr}(P)} \mathbb{I}`
    differs from :math:`\tilde N_j(t)` only by a multiple of the identity but
    is trace-free on the subspace of interest. The filter function value at
    zero frequency quantifies the sensitivity of the controls to quasi-static
    noise applied via the corresponding noise operator.

    Examples
    --------
    Calculate infidelity of the identity gate for a noiseless single qubit.

    >>> sigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])
    >>> hamiltonian = graph.pwc(
    ...     durations=np.array([0.1, 0.1]), values=np.array([sigma_z, -sigma_z])
