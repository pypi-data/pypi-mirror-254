ImageModifier is a Python package dedicated to providing an intuitive and efficient way to manipulate images. This package focuses on core image processing functions, allowing users to easily modify images through operations like rotating, slicing, adding frame, and adjusting RGB channels. The primary goal is to offer a straightforward way for basic yet powerful image transformations, making it a useful tool for image processing.

## Motivation

ImageModifier offers a streamlined and intuitive approach, making it highly accessible to a wide range of users, unlike many complex image processing tools that can be overwhelming for beginners and cumbersome for quick tasks. This package caters to both novices seeking an easy entry point into image manipulation and experienced users looking for a tool to perform quick modifications without the overhead of more complex software. With core functionalities like rotating, slicing, adding frames, and selecting RGB channels, ImageModifier simplifies these common tasks, allowing users to achieve their goals with minimal coding effort.

## Functions

**rotate_90**: Rotating an image by 90 degrees clockwise.

**add_frame**: Adding a frame to an image.

**select_channel**: Modifying an image with/without a specified RGB channel.

**slice_image**: Slicing an image into a specified number of horizontal and vertical slices.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install image_modifier
```

## Usage


### Setting up the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/image_modifier
$ cd image_modifier/
```

Create the environment:

```bash
$ conda env create -f image_modifier.yml
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
$ conda activate image_modifier
```

Install the packages via poetry:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

### Run Unit Tests

To run unit tests to ensure the functionality of the modifications, execute:

```bash
$ poetry run pytest
```

To include code coverage reporting, can also run:

```bash
$ poetry run pytest --cov=image_modifier
```

### **Importing Libraries and Image**

The following code can be used to import libraries and an image in python.

```bash
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> from PIL import Image

>>> image = Image.open("src/ubc.jpeg")  # Example for demonstration
>>> image_ary = np.array(image)
```

### **Function Usage**

image_modifier has four functions to modify an image.

#### **Rotate the image by 90 degree clockwise**

```bash
>>> from image_modifier.rotate_90 import rotate_90

>>> rotated_image = rotate_90(image_ary)
>>> plt.imshow(rotated_image)
```

#### **Add frame to the image**

```bash
>>> from image_modifier.add_frame import add_frame

>>> framed_image = add_frame(image_ary, border_size=30, color_name='blue', overlay=True)
>>> plt.imshow(framed_image)
```

#### **Select color channel**

```bash
>>> from image_modifier.select_channel import select_channel

>>> colored_image = select_channel(image_ary, 'r')
>>> plt.imshow(colored_image)
```

#### **Slice the image**

```bash
>>> from image_modifier.slice_image import slice_image

>>> slices = slice_image(image_ary, horizontal_slices=2, vertical_slices=2)
```
