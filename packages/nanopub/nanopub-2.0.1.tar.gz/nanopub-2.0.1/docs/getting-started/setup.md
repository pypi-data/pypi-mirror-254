# Setup instructions

## üì•Ô∏è Install the nanopub library
Install using pip:
```
pip install nanopub
```

## üêç Setup for users new to python
We recommend using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to install python and manage python dependencies

## üë§ Setup your profile

To publish to the nanopub server you need to setup your profile (note that you can use fetch and search functionality without a profile). This allows the nanopub server to identify you.

To check if your profile is properly set, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
np profile
```

To setup your profile, run the following interactive command:

```bash
np setup
```

This will setup the following:

### Stored profile
A local version of the profile will be stored in the nanopub user config dir (by default `HOMEDIR/.nanopub/profile.yml`)

### RSA keys
It will add and store RSA keys to sign your nanopublications. By default they are stored under `HOMEDIR/.nanopub/id_rsa` and `HOMEDIR/.nanopub/id_rsa.pub`.

### ORCID iD
This includes your [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) (i.e. https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000).

If you don't have an ORCID iD yet, you need to [register](https://orcid.org/register). We use the ORCID iD to automatically add as author to the provenance of any nanopublication you will publish using this library.

### Introductory nanopublication
We encourage you to make use of `np setup`'s option to publish your profile to the nanopub servers. This links your ORCID iD to your RSA key, thereby making all your publications linkable to you. Here is an [example introductory nanopublicaiton](http://purl.org/np/RAy1CYBfBYFd_TFI8Z_jr3taf6fB9u-grqsKyLzTmMvQI). The link to this nanopublication is also stored in your profile.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Check your profile

You can check the profile currently used by default by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
np profile
```
