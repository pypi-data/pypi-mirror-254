# FK-Graph

Visualise the graphs hidden within relational databases.

Schemas can sometimes fail to reflect the full complexity of the relationships in a
populated database, especially when the data has been added manually over a period of time.

This application creates a graph of foreign key relations in a populated database and
can be used to generate a plotly figure, or interactive dash app, showing these relations.
