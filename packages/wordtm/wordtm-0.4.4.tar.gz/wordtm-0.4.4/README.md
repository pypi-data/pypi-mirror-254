```python
from wordtm import meta, util, ta, tm, viz, pivot, quot

from importlib_metadata import version
print(version('wordtm'))

print(meta.get_module_info())

df = util.load_word()
cdf = util.load_word('cuv.csv')

df.head()

cdf.head()

rom = util.extract2(df, 'Rom 8')
crom = util.extract2(cdf, 'Rom 8')

ta.summary(rom, code=True)

viz.chi_wordcloud(cdf)

pivot.stat(cdf, chi=True)
```
