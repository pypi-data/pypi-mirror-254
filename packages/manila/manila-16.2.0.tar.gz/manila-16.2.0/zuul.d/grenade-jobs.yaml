    # This job is meant to validate the SLURP to SLURP release
    # upgrade so supposed to run on SLURP release gate only. To make sure
    # that, when the current master is not SLURP release, below branch variant will
    # stop running it on not SLURP release master. And once new SLURP release start
    # (means the current master is SLURP release), we need to remove the 'master'
    # from the below branch variant condition so that it again start running on
    # SLURP release master gate.
    # Along with grenade gate, this job runs on many other projects gate
    # also and in this job definition, we control for everyone to run on SLURP
    # release only.
