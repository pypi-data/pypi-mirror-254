# Puzzlepiece
**Puzzlepiece is a GUI-forward Python framework for automating experimental setups.** It focuses on abstracting communication with a piece of hardware into **standard inputs, outputs, and actions**. It then automatically **generates GUI components** for them, minimising the need for boilerplate code. Puzzlepiece allows the user to bring diverse controls into a single, consolidated application, and automate their interaction or experiment using a unified API, either through a built-in script language, or Interactive Python.

Check out the [`examples`](https://github.com/jdranczewski/puzzlepiece/tree/release/examples) folder for how to make an application (a Puzzle), and [`puzzlepiece/pieces/random_number.py`](https://github.com/jdranczewski/puzzlepiece/blob/release/puzzlepiece/pieces/random_number.py) for a simple example Piece. A Piece is a module that does a particular job (talks to a laser, scans a value, ...), and multiple of these brought together make up a Puzzle.

Documentation is in progress, available at https://puzzlepiece.readthedocs.io/

Currently the main requirement is `pyqtgraph`, and the code accesses whichever Python Qt bindings are installed _through_ `pyqtgraph`. Eventually the code is likely to be migrated to `QtPy`.
