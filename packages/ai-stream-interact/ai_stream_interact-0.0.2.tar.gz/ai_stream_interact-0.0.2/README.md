# AI Stream Interact üß†üéûÔ∏è aims to provide basic LLM interaction capabilities with video streams.
This package can easily be extended to accommodate different LLMs, but for this first version interactions were implemented only for [Google's Gemini Pro & Vision Pro Models](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials)

**Note: This is a basic Alpha version that's been written & tested in Ubuntu only so it may have unexpected behavior with other operating systems.**

## Example Usage:

1. Make sure you already have an API key for Gemini. (or get one [here](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup)).
2. Have a USB camera connected.
3. run `python3 `

There are 3 interaction modes available:

### Detect Default:
This fires up a window with your camera stream and whenever you press "**d**" will identify the object the camera is looking at. (Make sure to press "**d**" with the camera window focused and not your terminal).

### Detect with Custom Prompt:
Use this to write up a custom prompt before showing the model an object for custom interactions beyond just identifying objects.

### Interactions:
This just allows for back & forth chat with the model.
