def adjust_brightness(img, brightness_factor, verbose=False):
    """
    Adjust the brightness of an image and save the result.

    This function changes the brightness of an input image by a specified factor. The factor can be 
    positive to increase brightness or negative to decrease it. The brightness change is applied 
    uniformly to all pixels of the image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_path : str
        The file path to the image that needs brightness adjustment. The image can be in .jpg or .png format.
    brightness_factor : int or float
        A value that determines the amount by which to adjust the brightness. Positive values increase 
        brightness, while negative values decrease it.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The adjusted image is saved as a .png file at the same location as the input with "_brightened" appended
        to the original filename.

    Raises
    ------
    IOError
        If the image file cannot be opened or saved.
    
    Example:
    >>> img = mpimg.imread("tests/test_img_1.png")
    >>> img_adjusted = adjust_brightness(img, -0.3)
