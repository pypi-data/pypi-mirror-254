# EzMarkdownParser

EzMarkdownParser is a very simple Python package that converts Markdown text to HTML strings with its htmlify function. It is designed to handle basic Markdown elements such as paragraphs, headings, list items, bold text, and links. 

This parser was made for cs50w project #1 Wiki on 2024, so it only supports the tags required by the project specifications, wich are mentioned above.

## Installation

Install EzMarkdownParser using pip:

```bash
pip install ezmarkdownparser
```

## Usage

```python
from ezmarkdownparser import EzMarkdownParser

md_text = """
# Heading 1
This is a paragraph with some **bold text** and a [link](https://example.com).

## Heading 2
- List item 1
- List item 2
"""

parser = EzMarkdownParser()
html_text = parser.htmlify(md_text)
print(html_text)
```

## Features

- Convert Markdown headings to HTML `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.

- Wrap paragraphs with HTML `<p>` tags.
- Recognize and convert double asterisk (`**`) for bold text.
