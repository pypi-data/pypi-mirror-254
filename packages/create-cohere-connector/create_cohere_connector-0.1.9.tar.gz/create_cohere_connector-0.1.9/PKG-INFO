# Create Cohere Connector [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-green.svg)](https://github.com/dcarpintero/create-cohere-connector/)

Generates a custom Cohere Connector with one command. [Cohere Connectors](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/connectors) enable to combine Cohere's large language models (LLMs), which power the [Chat API](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/cochat-beta), with up-to-date factual information. They enhance Cohere's retrieval augmented generation (RAG) offering, and can respond to user questions and prompts with substantive, grounded generations that contain citations to external public or private knowledge bases.

If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/dcarpintero/create-cohere-connector/issues/new).

## 🧮 What is included?

Your environment will have everything you need to quickly prototype and deploy a custom Cohere Connector:

- ``API service`` implementing the required ``search`` endpoint using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (support for [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is planned). 
- ``Bearer Token Authentication`` using the Authorization header in HTTP requests. 
- ``Pydantic models`` for data validation and serialization.
- ``Client class`` to retrieve data from a custom data source.
- ``Deploy script`` to register your connector with Cohere.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. Install ``create-cohere-connector`` package:

```sh
pip install create-cohere-connector
```

2. Bootstrap your project:

```sh
create-cohere-connector
```

This will prompt for a project name:

```sh
Project name [myconnector]: hello-connector
Api framework [FastAPI]: FastAPI
Authentication [Bearer]: Bearer
Caching [None]: None
```

generate the initial project structure:

```
myconnector
├── README.md
├── deploy.py
├── Dockerfile
├── pyproject.toml
├── poetry.lock
├── .gitignore
└── provider
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── app.py
    ├── client.py
    └── datamodels.py
```

and install dependencies:

```sh
✅ Project created successfully!
```

3. Set environment variables

You might rename ``.env_template`` to ``.env``, and complete it.

4. Start API service

Inside the ``provider`` directory:

```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

5. Deploy Cohere Connector

```
python deploy.py
```
