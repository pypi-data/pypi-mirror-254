# firebase_user

This package is meant as a convenient client interface for the firebase REST API.
It doesn't use the firebase-admin sdk and doesn't require any admin credentials.
Only uses the firebase app config object of your app which can safely be exposed in the client codebase.
Supports Auth, Firestore and Storage for a quick yet powerful decentralized user management on the client side.

You need to setup a firebase project via the firebase console in order to use it.
Don't forget to set up proper security rules in firebase to prevent a user getting access to other users' data content. 

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install firebase-user
```

## Usage

```python
from firebase_user import FirebaseClient
import json

#Get the json app config of your project
with open('app_config.json','r') as f:
    config=json.load(f)

#Initialize the client with it
client=FirebaseClient(config)

#Sign up for a new account
client.auth.sign_up("email","password")
#or sign in
client.auth.sign_in("email","password")

#Check authentication success
print(client.authenticated)
# True

#Additional auth features
client.auth.change_password("new_password")
client.auth.refresh_token()
#This last method is called automatically in case the initial token expired

#Get the user's data from firestore (ie. the document with user's email adress as name in the 'users' collection) 
data=client.firestore.get_document()

#Make changes (nested attribute-style access supported)
data.age=34
data.hobbies=["Guitar playing","Basketball"]

#Dump changes to firestore
client.firestore.set_document(data)

#list files in the user's storage (includes files metadata)
files=client.storage.list_files()

#upload / download a file from / to cloud storage
client.storage.upload_file(local_file="./folder/file.txt",remote_file="folder/file.txt")
client.storage.download_file(remote_file="folder/file.txt",local_file="./folder/file.txt")

#load / dump a whole folder from / to the cloud storage (will overwrite the local / remote folder as a whole)
client.storage.load_folder("./folder")
client.storage.dump_folder("./folder")

#log out
client.auth.log_out()
print(client.authenticated)
# False

```
