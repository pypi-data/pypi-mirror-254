The idea of aggregating token log-probabilities is well known. You'll find it as a
subroutine in papers from `GPT-2
<https://paperswithcode.com/paper/language-models-are-unsupervised-multitask>`_\ [#]_ to
`Self-Consistency <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171>`_\ [#]_. The ``cappr``
implementation includes a few computational and statistical optimizations, while
maintaining a simple interface.

Here are some papers which focus on the idea of aggregating token log-probabilities.

`This paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02847>`_\ [#]_ presents a transposed version of
CAPPr. Its method was used in CAPPr's `demo for the Winograd Schema Challenge
<https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/blob/main/demos/openai/superglue/wsc.ipynb>`_.

`PET with multiple masks <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07118>`_\ [#]_ also aggregates
token log-probabilities to do prompt-completion classification. But these
log-probabilities are assumed to come from masked language models like BERT.
