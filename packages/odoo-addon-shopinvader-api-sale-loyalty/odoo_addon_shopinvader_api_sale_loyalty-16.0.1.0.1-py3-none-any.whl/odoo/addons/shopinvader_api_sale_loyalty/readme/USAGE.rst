Some routes are added to the `cart_router`.
Please note that for this router, the `/cart` prefix is not automatically
added, to allow to mount it as a nested app.
But you must ensure that this prefix is added when using this router.

See the README of `shopinvader_api_cart` for more details on how to do it.
