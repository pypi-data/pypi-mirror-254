## How it works
EmojiCrypt uses a simple algorithm to convert each letter and symbol of your message into a corresponding emoji, according to a numerical key that you choose. For example, if your key is 3, the letter “a” becomes the emoji 😁, the letter “b” becomes the emoji 🤣, and so on. To decrypt the message, you just have to do the reverse process, using the same key.
## How to install it
To install EmojiCrypt, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to install the colorama module, which you can do with the following command:
pip install -r requeriments.txt
or
pip3 install -r requeriments.txt

Then, you just have to clone this repository in your preferred directory:
