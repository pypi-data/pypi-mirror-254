# plasTeX dependency graphs

This is a [plasTeX](https://github.com/plastex/plastex/) plugin allowing
to build dependency graphs.

Needs graphviz and its dev libraries. If you have a user-friendly OS, it is
as simple as `sudo apt install graphviz libgraphviz-dev`. See https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html otherwise.
