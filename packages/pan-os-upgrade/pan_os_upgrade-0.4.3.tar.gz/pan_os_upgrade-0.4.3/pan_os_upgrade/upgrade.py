    decisions based on this status and the dry_run flag. The function guides whether the upgrade should proceed
    and if any HA-specific actions are needed, such as suspending HA synchronization on the active device.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device being evaluated for upgrade. This can be either a Firewall or a Panorama instance and may be part of an HA configuration.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device, used for logging and identification.
    dry_run : bool
        Indicates whether to simulate the upgrade process (True) without making actual changes or to execute the upgrade (False).

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[bool, Optional[Union[Firewall, Panorama]]]
        A tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating if the upgrade should proceed, and the second element is an optional device instance representing the HA peer, if relevant.

    Verifies synchronization status between HA peers for a Palo Alto Networks device.

    This function checks if the High Availability (HA) peers are synchronized, which is crucial before performing
    operations that could affect the device state, such as upgrades. It uses HA details to determine synchronization
    status and supports a strict mode that halts the script on synchronization failures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device. Used for logging to identify the device being checked.
    ha_details : dict
        Detailed HA information for the target device, including synchronization status with its HA peer.
    strict_sync_check : bool, optional
        Determines the handling of synchronization failures: if True (default), the script exits on failure;
        if False, it logs a warning and continues.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if HA peers are synchronized, indicating it's safe to proceed with sensitive operations. False indicates
        a lack of synchronization, with the script's response depending on the `strict_sync_check` setting.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        If `strict_sync_check` is True and synchronization fails, the script will terminate to prevent potential issues.

    Example
    -------
    Performing a strict HA synchronization check:
        >>> ha_details = {'result': {'group': {'running-sync': 'synchronized'}}}
        >>> perform_ha_sync_check('firewall1', ha_details)

        False  # HA peers are not synchronized, but script continues

    Notes
    -----
    - Synchronization checks are essential in HA environments to ensure consistency between devices before making changes.

        Details of the HA setup of the target device, if applicable.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the specified software version is available and constitutes a valid upgrade; False otherwise. This includes scenarios where the base image is required but cannot be downloaded after the specified number of retries.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        Exits the script if the specified version represents a downgrade or is not appropriate for upgrade due to other criteria.

    Example
    -------

It issues an operational command to the target device to suspend HA, effectively transitioning the active device to a non-participative state in HA operations. The function verifies the operation's success through the device's response and logs the outcome.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The active device in an HA pair where HA functionality needs to be suspended. It could be either a Firewall or a Panorama appliance.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device, utilized for logging and identification purposes.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the HA suspension command is successfully executed on the target device, indicating that HA functionality has been temporarily disabled. False if the operation encounters an error or fails.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raises a generic exception and logs the error if the operational command fails or encounters an issue during execution.

    Example
    -------
    Suspending HA on the active device of an HA pair:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='admin')
        >>> suspension_result = suspend_ha_active(firewall, 'firewall-active.example.com')
        >>> print("HA suspension successful" if suspension_result else "HA suspension failed")

    Notes
    -----
    - This operation is critical in HA environments, especially when performing system upgrades or maintenance that requires preventing automatic failover.
    - It's important to coordinate this action with network management policies and potentially with the suspension of the counterpart HA device to manage network redundancy effectively.

    Evaluates and logs the outcomes of specific readiness tests for a firewall, crucial for assessing upgrade feasibility.

    This function inspects the results of predefined readiness tests that have been executed on a firewall to determine its preparedness for an upgrade. It logs the outcomes of these tests, emphasizing the severity of any failures and their potential impact on the upgrade process. For tests marked as critical, a failure will lead to the termination of the script to avert a problematic upgrade.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : dict
        The outcomes of the readiness tests, structured as a dictionary where each key is a test name and its value is a dictionary containing the test's 'state' (True for pass, False for fail) and a 'reason' for the test outcome.
    hostname : str
        The identifier for the firewall being evaluated, used to contextualize log entries.
    test_name : str
        The name of the specific test being assessed, which should correspond to a key in the 'result' dictionary.
    test_info : dict
        Detailed information about the test, including a descriptive 'description', the 'log_level' for logging the outcome, and an 'exit_on_failure' boolean that dictates whether a failed test should halt further script execution.

    Workflow
    --------
    1. Extract the outcome of the specified test from the 'result' dictionary.
    2. Formulate a log entry combining the test's description and the reason for its outcome.
    3. Log the entry, adjusting the log level according to the test's importance and the nature of its outcome.
    4. If a critical test fails (as indicated by 'exit_on_failure' being True), log a critical error and stop the script execution.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        If a test deemed critical to the upgrade's success fails, the script will terminate to prevent potentially adverse actions.

    Example
    -------
    Assessing and logging a hypothetical connectivity test result:
        >>> result = {'connectivity_test': {'state': False, 'reason': 'Network unreachable'}}

For elements containing child elements, a new nested dictionary is created. When multiple child elements share the same tag, they are grouped into a list within the parent dictionary. This utility is particularly useful for processing XML data into a more manageable and Pythonic structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : ET.Element
        The XML ElementTree element to be converted. This can be the root element or any subelement within an XML tree.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A nested dictionary representation of the input XML element. The dictionary structure mirrors the XML hierarchy, with tags as keys and text content, further nested dictionaries, or lists of dictionaries as values.

    Examples
    --------
    Converting a simple XML element with no children:
        >>> xml_string = '<status>active</status>'
        >>> element = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
        >>> flatten_xml_to_dict(element)

    Notes
    -----
    - XML attributes are not included in the output dictionary; only tags and text content are processed.
    - Repeated tags at the same level are stored as a list to preserve the XML structure within the dictionary format.
    - The function provides a simplified view of the XML content, suitable for data manipulation and extraction tasks.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

def get_firewalls_from_panorama(
    panorama: Panorama,
    **filters,
) -> list[Firewall]:
    """
    Retrieves a list of Firewall objects managed by a Panorama appliance, optionally filtered by specified attributes.

    This function communicates with a Panorama appliance to obtain a list of all firewalls under its management. It allows for the application of filters based on firewall attributes such as model, serial number, software version, etc., to refine the selection of firewalls returned. The function utilizes the Panorama API to fetch the relevant data, which is then parsed and converted into Firewall objects for easy manipulation within the script. This is particularly useful for scenarios where operations need to be targeted at specific subsets of firewalls, such as upgrades, configurations, or reporting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    panorama : Panorama
        An instance of the Panorama class, representing the Panorama appliance from which the managed firewalls are to be retrieved. This instance must be properly initialized and authenticated.
    **filters : dict, optional
        Arbitrary keyword arguments where each key represents a firewall attribute to filter by (e.g., 'model', 'serial', 'version'), and the corresponding value is a regular expression string used to match against the firewall's attribute value.

    Returns
    -------
    list[Firewall]
        A list containing Firewall objects for each firewall managed by the specified Panorama appliance that matches the provided filtering criteria. If no filters are specified, all managed firewalls are returned.

    Examples
    --------
    Fetching all firewalls managed by Panorama:
        >>> all_firewalls = get_firewalls_from_panorama(panorama_instance)

    Fetching firewalls of a specific model managed by Panorama:
        >>> specific_model_firewalls = get_firewalls_from_panorama(panorama_instance, model='PA-220')

    Notes
    -----
    - This function is essential for scripts that perform batch operations on multiple firewalls managed by Panorama, allowing for precise targeting of devices.
    - The filtering feature supports complex selection criteria, making the function highly versatile in managing large deployments.
    - If `settings_file_path` is specified and contains relevant filters, those filters can override or augment the filters provided as arguments to this function.

    No exceptions are explicitly raised by this function; however, API call failures due to network issues, authentication errors, or invalid filter syntax can result in runtime errors that should be handled by the calling code.

def ip_callback(value: str) -> str:
    """
    Validates and returns a given string if it's a resolvable hostname or a valid IP address.

    This function is primarily intended as a callback for CLI input validation, ensuring that provided
    values are either valid IPv4/IPv6 addresses or hostnames that can be resolved. It first checks if the
    input is a valid IP address using Python's 'ipaddress' module. If not, it attempts to resolve the string
    as a hostname. If both checks fail, the function raises a Typer error to prompt the user for a valid input.
    This ensures that subsequent operations receive only valid network endpoint identifiers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : str
        The user-provided string intended to represent either a hostname or an IP address.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The original input string if it is successfully validated as either a resolvable hostname or a valid IP address.

    Raises
    ------
    typer.BadParameter
        If the input string cannot be validated as either a resolvable hostname or a valid IP address, this exception is raised to signal to the user that the provided input is invalid and needs correction.

    Example
    -------
    Using `ip_callback` as a Typer option callback to ensure valid network endpoint input:
        >>> @app.command()
        >>> def check_endpoint(host: str = typer.Option(..., callback=ip_callback)):
        >>>     print(f"Checking endpoint: {host}")

    Notes
    -----
    - The function leverages both DNS resolution checks and the 'ipaddress' module for comprehensive validation.
    - It is particularly useful in CLI applications where early validation of network-related user input is crucial.
    - If `settings_file_path` is specified and contains relevant network settings, these can potentially be used to adjust or bypass validation based on the application's requirements.

) -> FromAPIResponseMixin:
    """
    Transforms an XML element or tree from an API response into a structured Pydantic model instance.

    This utility function is designed to facilitate the conversion of XML data, typically retrieved from API
    responses, into structured Pydantic model instances. It streamlines the process of parsing XML and mapping
    the extracted data to predefined Pydantic model fields, enabling more efficient and type-safe data handling
    within Python applications. The function assumes that the provided Pydantic model includes a mixin or
    inherits from a base class designed to handle data deserialization from API responses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : Union[ET.Element, ET.ElementTree]
        The root XML element or an entire XML document tree that is to be converted. This data structure usually
        represents a portion or the entirety of an API response in XML format.
    model : type[FromAPIResponseMixin]
        A Pydantic model class that inherits from `FromAPIResponseMixin`, defining the schema for the expected
        data structure. The model should include fields corresponding to the XML data to be processed, facilitating
        the mapping of XML elements to model attributes.

    Returns
    -------
    FromAPIResponseMixin
        An instance of the specified Pydantic model, populated with the data extracted from the provided XML
        element or tree. The model instance offers a structured, type-safe interface to the API response data,
        aligned with the model's schema.

    Example
    -------
    Parsing an XML API response into a Pydantic model:
        >>> xml_response = ET.fromstring('<user><id>101</id><name>John Doe</name></user>')
        >>> UserModel = type('UserModel', (FromAPIResponseMixin, BaseModel), {'id': int, 'name': str})

        # The 'user' object is an instance of 'UserModel' with 'id' and 'name' populated from the XML response.

    Notes
    -----
    - This function abstracts the complexities of XML parsing and data mapping, enabling developers to work with
      API response data in a more Pythonic and object-oriented manner.
    - It is important that the Pydantic model accurately reflects the structure of the XML response to ensure
      correct data mapping. Discrepancies between the model and the XML structure may result in incomplete or
      incorrect data representation.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the XML-to-dictionary conversion results in a structure that cannot be directly mapped to the provided
        Pydantic model, a ValueError may be raised, indicating a potential mismatch between the model schema and
        the XML data structure.

    Parses a version string into a tuple of integers representing its major, minor, maintenance, and hotfix components.

    This utility function analyzes a version string, expected to be in the format of 'major.minor.maintenance' or
    'major.minor.maintenance-hhotfix', and extracts the numerical components. The hotfix component is optional and
    denoted by a '-h' followed by its number. If a component is missing, it defaults to 0 to maintain a consistent
    tuple structure. This parsing facilitates version comparison and sorting by converting version strings into
    a uniform tuple format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    version : str
        The version string to parse, adhering to the 'major.minor.maintenance' or
        'major.minor.maintenance-hhotfix' format. Each segment (major, minor, maintenance, hotfix) should be
        a numerical value.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[int, int, int, int]
        A tuple containing four integers representing the major, minor, maintenance versions, and the hotfix
        number, respectively. The hotfix number defaults to 0 if not specified in the input string.

    Examples
    --------
    Parsing a version string without a hotfix:
        >>> parse_version("10.0.1")

    Verifies if a given hostname can be resolved to an IP address using DNS lookup.

    This function is crucial for network-related operations, as it checks the resolvability of a hostname. It performs a DNS query to determine if the hostname can be translated into an IP address, thereby validating its presence on the network. A successful DNS resolution implies the hostname is active and reachable, while a failure might indicate an issue with the hostname itself, DNS configuration, or broader network problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The hostname to be resolved, such as 'example.com', to verify network reachability and DNS configuration.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Returns True if the DNS resolution is successful, indicating the hostname is valid and reachable. Returns False if the resolution fails, suggesting potential issues with the hostname, DNS setup, or network connectivity.

    Example
    -------
    Validating hostname resolution:
        >>> resolve_hostname('google.com')
        True  # This would indicate that 'google.com' is successfully resolved, suggesting it is reachable.

        False  # This would indicate a failure in resolving 'invalid.hostname', pointing to potential DNS or network issues.

    Notes
    -----
    - This function is intended as a preliminary network connectivity check before attempting further network operations.
    - It encapsulates exception handling for DNS resolution errors, logging them for diagnostic purposes while providing a simple boolean outcome to the caller.

    This command orchestrates the steps required for upgrading a firewall appliance, encompassing initial validations, environment setup, and execution of the upgrade process. It is capable of operating in a 'dry run' mode, which simulates the upgrade process without applying any changes, allowing for validation of upgrade prerequisites and assessment of potential issues. The command leverages a series of internal functions to prepare the environment, verify connectivity, ensure compatibility with the target version, and, if all checks pass, proceed with the upgrade.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The IP address or DNS hostname of the firewall to be upgraded. Must be accessible from the execution environment.
    username : str
        The administrative username for the firewall, used for API or CLI authentication.
    password : str
        The corresponding password for the provided administrative username.

    This command facilitates the upgrade of a Panorama appliance by executing a series of preparatory actions, including validation of connectivity, compatibility checks with the target version, and the actual upgrade process. The dry run mode allows operators to simulate the upgrade steps without making any modifications to the Panorama appliance. The command leverages internal utility functions to ensure the environment is correctly configured, to establish a connection to the Panorama, and to conduct the upgrade according to the parameters specified.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The network address of the Panorama appliance, either as an IP address or a DNS-resolvable hostname.
    username : str
        The administrative username required for authentication on the Panorama appliance.
    password : str
        The corresponding password for the specified administrative username.
    target_version : str
        The target version of PAN-OS to which the Panorama appliance is to be upgraded.
    dry_run : bool, optional
        A boolean flag indicating whether to simulate the upgrade process without applying changes, defaulting to False.

    Examples
    --------
    Directly upgrading a Panorama appliance:
        $ python upgrade.py panorama --hostname panorama.example.com --username admin --password secure123 --version 10.0.0

    Conducting a dry run for the upgrade process:
        $ python upgrade.py panorama --hostname panorama.example.com --username admin --password secure123 --version 10.0.0 --dry-run

    Notes
    -----
    - It is critical to ensure that the Panorama appliance is accessible and that the provided credentials are correct before initiating the upgrade process.
    - Utilizing the dry run mode is strongly recommended for validating the upgrade path and identifying any potential obstacles without risking the operational state of the Panorama appliance.
    - Settings for the upgrade process, such as logging levels and file paths, may be overridden by a `settings.yaml` file if present and detected by the implementation of `common_setup` and other invoked functions within this command.

    Executes a coordinated upgrade of multiple firewalls managed by a Panorama appliance using specified criteria.

    This command streamlines the process of upgrading a batch of firewalls by leveraging Panorama's centralized management capabilities. It supports filtering to target specific devices for the upgrade and offers a dry run option for validation without making changes. The function initiates by preparing the environment, validating connectivity to Panorama, and then sequentially or concurrently upgrading each managed firewall that meets the filter criteria.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The network address of the Panorama appliance, either as an IP address or a DNS-resolvable hostname.
    username : str
        The administrative username required for authentication on the Panorama appliance.
    password : str
        The corresponding password for the specified administrative username.
    target_version : str
        The PAN-OS version to which the targeted firewalls will be upgraded.
    filter : str, optional
        A string used to define filtering criteria for selecting specific firewalls managed by Panorama, default is empty which implies no filtering.
    dry_run : bool, optional
        A flag to indicate whether to simulate the upgrade process without making any actual changes, default is False.

    Examples
    --------
    Performing a batch upgrade of firewalls:
        $ python upgrade.py batch --hostname panorama.example.com --username admin --password adminpassword --version 9.1.3 --filter "model=PA-220"

    Conducting a dry run of a batch upgrade:
        $ python upgrade.py batch --hostname panorama.example.com --username admin --password adminpassword --version 9.1.3 --filter "location=DataCenter" --dry-run

    Notes
    -----
    - Ensure connectivity to Panorama and validity of credentials before initiating the batch upgrade.
    - The dry run option is highly recommended for assessing the upgrade's feasibility and identifying any preparatory actions required without impacting the operational state of the firewalls.
    - Configuration settings, such as logging levels and paths, can be customized through a `settings.yaml` file if available. The presence of this file and its path may be indicated by the global variable `settings_file_path` if implemented in the script.

    Generates a settings.yaml file allowing customization of script configurations.

    This interactive command guides the user through a series of prompts to configure various aspects of the script's behavior, including concurrency, logging, reboot strategies, readiness checks, snapshots, and timeout settings. Each configuration section allows the user to specify preferences, such as the number of concurrent threads, logging levels, and file paths, among others. Customization of readiness checks and snapshots is also offered, enabling selective execution based on user requirements. The resulting configurations are saved to a 'settings.yaml' file in the current working directory, which the script can subsequently use to override default settings.

    Configuration Sections
    ----------------------
    - Concurrency: Defines the number of concurrent operations, particularly useful for batch operations.
    - Logging: Sets logging preferences including verbosity level, file path, maximum size, and log retention count.
    - Reboot: Configures retry intervals and maximum attempts for device reboots during the upgrade process.
    - Readiness Checks: Allows customization of pre-upgrade readiness checks to run.
    - Snapshots: Enables configuration of pre and post-upgrade snapshots for comparison and rollback purposes.
    - Timeout Settings: Determines timeout values for device connections and command executions.

    Notes
    -----
    - This command is part of the setup process and is intended to be run prior to executing upgrade commands.
    - The 'settings.yaml' file created by this command can be edited manually for further customization.
    - Default values are provided for each configuration option, with the option to accept the default or provide a custom value.
