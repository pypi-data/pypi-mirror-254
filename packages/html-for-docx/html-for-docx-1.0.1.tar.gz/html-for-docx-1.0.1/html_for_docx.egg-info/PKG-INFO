# HTML FOR DOCX
Convert html to docx, this project is a fork from descontinued [pqzx/html2docx](https://github.com/pqzx/html2docx).

### To install

`pip install html-for-docx`

### Usage

Take a look on [pqzx/html2docx](https://github.com/pqzx/html2docx) project to see examples of usage.

### Why

My goal to fork and fix/update this package was to complete my current task at work that envolves manipulating a html to docs which the original couldn't complete because was lacking of few features and bugs, so instead creating a package from zero, I prefer update this one.
