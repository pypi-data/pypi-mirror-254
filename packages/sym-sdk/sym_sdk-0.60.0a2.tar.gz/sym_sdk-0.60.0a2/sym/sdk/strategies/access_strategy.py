        This method is meant to be called in implementations of the ``AccessStrategy`` class; e.g.,
        :func:`~sym.sdk.strategies.access_strategy.AccessStrategy.escalate` and
        :func:`~sym.sdk.strategies.access_strategy.AccessStrategy.deescalate`, as a way to resolve
        the mapping of a Sym user to their corresponding identity in the external service being
        interacted with.

        To be clear, this method does not *need* to be called in situations where there is no need
        to maintain a mapping of users to external identities; for example, if the user's email
        address, which is already captured by Sym, is all that is needed by the external service.

        This method's source can also be used as a reference for how the external identity lookup

        This method is used to fetch the external identity of the requester when Sym does not
        already have that information available. Commonly, this is when a user makes a request
        utilizing a given :class:`~sym.sdk.strategies.integration.Integration` for the first time.

        This method should return a string that represents the user's unique user ID in the
        service this Strategy interacts with; or, more specifically, whatever is needed to identify
        the user being escalated or de-escalated in the service that is performing the escalation/
        de-escalation. The user ID value can be any string; it is treated as an opaque value by the
        Sym platform. For example, if the Strategy were interacting with AWS IAM, the user ID
        returned by this method would be the user's ARN.

        If the user's identity cannot be fetched, or this automated remote identity discovery does
        not need to be implemented, this method may return ``None`` instead; however, note that
        ``get_requester_identity()`` will raise an
        :class:`~sym.sdk.exceptions.identity.IdentityNotFound` exception if the requester does not
        already have an identity.

        To be clear, this method does not *need* to be implemented in situations where there is no
        need to maintain a mapping of users to external identities; for example, if the user's email
        address, which is already captured by Sym, is all that is needed by the external service.

        Implementers should not call this method directly; instead, use
        :func:`~sym.sdk.strategies.access_strategy.AccessStrategy.get_requester_identity`,
        which calls this method as needed.

        If this method returns a non-``None`` value, ``get_requester_identity()`` will persist the
        value to the user saved in Sym so that this lookup doesn't need to be performed again.

        Args:
            user: The user to fetch an external service identity for

        Returns:
            An opaque string value representing the user's unique identifier in the external
            service, or ``None`` if this lookup should not or cannot be performed.
