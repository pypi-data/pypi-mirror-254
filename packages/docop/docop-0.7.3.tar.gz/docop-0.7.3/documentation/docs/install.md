# Installing Docop

To get started, do a pip install:

```bash
pip install docop
```

And then create a new project directory:

```bash
docop init <directoryname>
```

This will create your project directory with some subdirectories and add an example `config.yaml` file for you.

Play around with the [command-line tool](cmdline.md), read the docs on how to [configure docop](config.md), use and create [tasks](tasks.md) and [pipes](pipes.md) etc.
