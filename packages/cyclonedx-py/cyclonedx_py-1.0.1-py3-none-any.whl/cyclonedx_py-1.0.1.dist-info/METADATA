# Alias for package `cyclonedx-bom`

<!-- This file doubles as the readme of published alias packages. -->

The package `cyclonedx-bom` may use a script entrypoint that does not match the package's name on PyPI.
To prevent unexpected existence of a package on PyPI that could cause confusion, some alias package is published.

Instead of relying on this very package, you should require the actual tool:
* [`cyclonedx-bom`](https://pypi.org/project/cyclonedx-bom/)
