           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## Introduction

**K**eras **Im**age **M**odels (`kimm`) is a collection of image models, blocks and layers written in Keras 3. The goal is to offer SOTA models with pretrained weights in a user-friendly manner.

**KIMM** is:

🚀 A model zoo where almost all models come with **pre-trained weights on ImageNet**.

> [!NOTE]
> The accuracy of the converted models can be found at [results-imagenet.csv (timm)](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/results/results-imagenet.csv) and [https://keras.io/api/applications/ (keras)](https://keras.io/api/applications/),
> and the numerical differences of the converted models can be verified in `tools/convert_*.py`.

✨ Exposing a common API identical to offcial `keras.applications.*`.
  
```python
model = kimm.models.RegNetY002(
    input_tensor: keras.KerasTensor = None,
    input_shape: typing.Optional[typing.Sequence[int]] = None,
    include_preprocessing: bool = True,
    include_top: bool = True,
    pooling: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    dropout_rate: float = 0.0,
    classes: int = 1000,
    classifier_activation: str = "softmax",
    weights: typing.Optional[str] = "imagenet",
    name: str = "RegNetY002",
)
```

🔥 Integrated with **feature extraction** capability.

```python
model = kimm.models.ConvNeXtAtto(feature_extractor=True)
x = keras.random.uniform([1, 224, 224, 3])
y = model.predict(x)
# y becomes a dict
for k, v in y.items():
    print(k, v.shape)
```

🧰 Providing APIs to export models to `.tflite` and `.onnx`.

```python
# tensorflow backend
keras.backend.set_image_data_format("channels_last")
model = kimm.models.MobileNetV3W050Small()
kimm.export.export_tflite(model, [224, 224, 3], "model.tflite")
```

```python
# torch backend
keras.backend.set_image_data_format("channels_first")
model = kimm.models.MobileNetV3W050Small()
kimm.export.export_onnx(model, [3, 224, 224], "model.onnx")
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `kimm.export.export_tflite` is currently restricted to `tensorflow` backend and `channels_last`.
> `kimm.export.export_onnx` is currently restricted to `torch` backend and `channels_first`.

🔧 Supporting the **reparameterization** technique.

```python
model = kimm.models.RepVGGA0()
reparameterized_model = kimm.utils.get_reparameterized_model(model)
# or
# reparameterized_model = model.get_reparameterized_model()
model.summary()
# Total params: 9,132,616 (34.84 MB)
reparameterized_model.summary()
# Total params: 8,309,384 (31.70 MB)
y1 = model.predict(x)
y2 = reparameterized_model.predict(x)
np.testing.assert_allclose(y1, y2, atol=1e-5)
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install keras kimm -U
```

## Quickstart

### Image classification using the model pretrained on ImageNet

```python
import keras
from keras import ops
from keras import utils
from keras.applications.imagenet_utils import decode_predictions

import kimm

# Use `kimm.list_models` to get the list of available models
print(kimm.list_models())

# Specify the name and other arguments to filter the result
print(kimm.list_models("vision_transformer", weights="imagenet"))  # fuzzy search

# Initialize the model with pretrained weights
model = kimm.models.VisionTransformerTiny16()
image_size = (model._default_size, model._default_size)

# Load an image as the model input
image_path = keras.utils.get_file(
    "african_elephant.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/Bvro0YD.png"
)
image = utils.load_img(image_path, target_size=image_size)
image = utils.img_to_array(image)
x = ops.convert_to_tensor(image)
x = ops.expand_dims(x, axis=0)

# Predict
preds = model.predict(x)
print("Predicted:", decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])
```

```bash
['ConvMixer1024D20', 'ConvMixer1536D20', 'ConvMixer736D32', 'ConvNeXtAtto', ...]
['VisionTransformerBase16', 'VisionTransformerBase32', 'VisionTransformerSmall16', ...]
