# no_action

An incremental automation library to eliminate toil in processes.

## Description

Ideologically based on Dan Slimmon's [Do-nothing scripting][dns] article from 2019. `no_action`
provides a `Step` class that can be sub-classed and customized as well as a `Prodecure` class that
wraps a series of ordered steps.

First, one writes a series of Steps with the manual details in their docstring and the procedure
prints the docstrings, a glorified checklist. Over time though, with each Step encapsulated in
a discrete class, Steps of a procedure can be automated by writing code that actually does what is
described in the docstring (override the `Step.execute()` method). Soon, your procedures are fully
automated and can be hooked into an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), a runner, or other automation
orchestration system.

## Installation

This library can be found on PyPI. Run the following command to install the library into your
project.

`python3 -m pip install no-action`

<!--
## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the
smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated
examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat
room, an email address, etc.

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how
to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that
they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future
self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code
quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having
instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting
a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
