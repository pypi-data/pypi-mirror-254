# Industry Time Series Library

## Time Series Manipulation for Industry Data

This repository hosts the **industry-ts**: _Industry Time Series_ Library --- a Python library that provides functions to manipulate time series collected from industrial contexts.

This project aims to address the necessity for open-source tools developed for solving problems with data collected from industrial process. 

The modules introduced provide a variety of functions that are particularly tailored to industry data, directed to working with its most common issues, such as discontinuities in process measurements and faulty sensors.

## Main Features

* **Data Generation**: Generate synthetic data from well defined stochastic processes for testing and benchmarking purposes.
* **Modelling**: Fit time series models to data.
* **Preprocessing**: Preprocess time series with filtering, feature engineering and other techniques.

## How to use it

The package is available in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/industryts/), and can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install industryts
```

Alternatively, to use the library, you can clone the repository and install it with pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Industry-Time-Series/industry-ts.git
cd industry-ts
git checkout packaging
pip install .
```
