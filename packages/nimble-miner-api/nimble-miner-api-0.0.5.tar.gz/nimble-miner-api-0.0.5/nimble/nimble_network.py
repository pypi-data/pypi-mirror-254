class NimbleNetwork:
    """
    The NimbleNetwork class in nimble serves as a crucial interface for interacting with the nimble blockchain,
    facilitating a range of operations essential for the decentralized machine learning network. This class
    enables neurons (network participants) to engage in activities such as registering on the network, managing
    staked weights, setting inter-neuronal weights, and participating in consensus mechanisms.

    The nimble network operates on a digital ledger where each neuron holds stakes (S) and learns a set
    of inter-peer weights (W). These weights, set by the neurons themselves, play a critical role in determining
    the ranking and incentive mechanisms within the network. Higher-ranked neurons, as determined by their
    contributions and trust within the network, receive more incentives.

    The NbNetwork class connects to various nimble networks like the main 'nimble' network or local test
    networks, providing a gateway to the blockchain layer of nimble. It leverages a staked weighted trust
    system and consensus to ensure fair and distributed incentive mechanisms, where incentives (I) are
    primarily allocated to neurons that are trusted by the majority of the network&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;.

    Additionally, nimble introduces a speculation-based reward mechanism in the form of bonds (B), allowing
    neurons to accumulate bonds in other neurons, speculating on their future value. This mechanism aligns
    with market-based speculation, incentivizing neurons to make judicious decisions in their inter-neuronal
    investments.

    Attributes:
        network (str): The name of the nimble network (e.g., 'nimble', 'test', 'archive', 'local') the instance
                       is connected to, determining the blockchain interaction context.
        chain_endpoint (str): The blockchain node endpoint URL, enabling direct communication
                              with the nimble blockchain for transaction processing and data retrieval.

    Example Usage:
        # Connect to the main nimble network (nimble).
        nimble_nbnetwork = nbnetwork(network='nimble')

        # Register a new neuron on the network.
        wallet = nimble.wallet(...)  # Assuming a wallet instance is created.
        success = nimble_nbnetwork.register(wallet=wallet, netuid=netuid)

        # Set inter-neuronal weights for collaborative learning.
        success = nimble_nbnetwork.set_weights(wallet=wallet, netuid=netuid, uids=[...], weights=[...])

        # Speculate by accumulating bonds in other promising neurons.
        success = nimble_nbnetwork.delegate(wallet=wallet, delegate_ss58=other_neuron_ss58, amount=bond_amount)

        # Get the metagraph for a specific subnet using given nbnetwork connection
        metagraph = nbnetwork.metagraph(netuid=netuid)

    By facilitating these operations, the NbNetwork class is instrumental in maintaining the decentralized
    intelligence and dynamic learning environment of the nimble network, as envisioned in its foundational
    principles and mechanisms described in the NeurIPS paper.
