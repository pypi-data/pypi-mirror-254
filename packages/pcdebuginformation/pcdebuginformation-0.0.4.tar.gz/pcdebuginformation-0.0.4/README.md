# hybridtoolkit

## Greetings.
Hello Reader,

I am Ravi Nain. I have created this python package to retrieve system details quick and easy.
This will be useful for developers who need to understand the system or IT guy who want to ensure the Operating system security.

This ToolKit is designed to get quick information of Linux Distribution Systems.

If you want to contribute please reach me in github issues or via my email (ravinain100@gmail.com)
