## Typing stubs for Flask-Migrate

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`Flask-Migrate`](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-Migrate) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`Flask-Migrate`.

This version of `types-Flask-Migrate` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `Flask-Migrate==4.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/Flask-Migrate. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a2a6aee89213d87ed6f86cf723a7fc4ed3c219a2` and was tested
with mypy 1.8.0, pyright 1.1.342, and
pytype 2024.1.24.
