We often need to access system/platform specific information to make certain
decisions in our code, and more often than not end up with lengthy pieces of
code to accomplish this. And thatâ€™s not to mention all the different modules
available to get that information.

**This System** aims at keeping your code short, clear, easy to read and
maintain by providing all the available system information in a single object
with a logical structure that results in more *pythonic* code.
