## About The Project

__IStacky__ is a __lightweight image processing library__ based on the [Ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) library and designed to be used in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). The main idea is to provide a __simple__ and __intuitive interface__ to __stack images__ and apply number of modifications to them, such as __cropping__, __resizing__ or __background removal__.

This project has been made to be used in the context of __machine learning__ and __computer vision projects__, where the user needs to __quickly__ and __easily__ create output images that combines several images: plots, photos, logos etc.
