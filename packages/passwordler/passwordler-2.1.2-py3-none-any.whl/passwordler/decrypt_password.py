    """
    Decrypt an encrypted password using a simple substitution cipher.
    
    The function uses a substitution cipher to decrypt an encrypted string. The 
    original set is replaced with a randomly shuffled character from the same set.
    The random seed is utilized to make sure that the encryption and the decryption 
    matches.   

    Parameters:
    - encrypted_password (str): The encrypted password to be decrypted.
    - random_seed (int): Seed for the random number generator to ensure that 
                         encryption and decryption match. Default is 123.

    Returns:
    - str: The decrypted password.

    The function uses a substitution cipher where each character in the original
    set is replaced with a randomly shuffled character from the same set. The random
    seed is utilized to maintain consistent decryption results when needed.

    Example:
    >>> original_password = 'Monty Python'
    >>> encrypted_password = encrypt_password(original_password, random_seed = 123)
    >>> decrypted_password = decrypt_password(encrypted_password, random_seed = 123)
    Output: 'Monty Python'
