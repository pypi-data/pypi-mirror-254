YSO standard classification
===========================

This Python package is used to classify young stellar objects using the
standard classification scheme originally devised by Lada et al. (1984).

It determines the infrared spectral index \(\alpha_{IR}\) in the range
from \(2\,\mu\mathrm{m}\) to \(20\,\mu\mathrm{m}\), estimating the slope
of the spectral energy distribution. Based on the measured slope, the
YSOs are divided into 5 distinct classes (0/I, flat spectrum, II,
III with debris disk, III no disk/MS star).

This project is under active development.
