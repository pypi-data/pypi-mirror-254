# Frequenz Common API Release Notes

## New Features

- Add a energy message for electricity trading markets
- Add backwards compatibility with v0.3.x

  This release includes the top-level files present in the v0.3.x release, so the Microgrid API v0.15.x can depend on a newer version of the Common API.
